"First-time, full-time student retention rate at four-year institutions",RET_FT4_POOLED,,,IPEDS,,"The proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who were enrolled at the institution in the fall 1 year after starting at the institution, calculated from the IPEDS Fall Enrollment component. Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. The retention rate is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year that are enrolled in the fall term of the current academic year divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year. For 4-year institutions, this metric is limited to full-time, first-time, bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking undergraduate students. For less-than-4-year institutions, this metric applies to all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. This metric is not available prior to the 2004-05 academic year. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent."
