"Share of undergraduate, degree-/certificate-seeking students who are part-time",12.56348969,student,part_time_share,float,,PPTUG_EF,,,IPEDS,Yes,"The proportion of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled part time in the fall term, calculated from the IPEDS Fall Enrollment component. This metric does not apply during 2000-01, when degree/certificate-seeking status was not collected. It is calculated as the number of part-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates divided by the total number of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates. It includes non-first-time undergraduates. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent."

It is calculated from values in the IPEDS Institutional Characteristics and Student Financial Aid components. Separate metrics are calculated for academic-year institutions and program-year institutions. For academic-year institutions, average cost of attendance represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), average cost of attendance represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution, and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LPROGRAM), this represents the cost for the full program."
