It was founded on February 26, 1887 as Troy State Normal School within the Alabama State University System by an Act of the Alabama Legislature. It is the flagship university of the Troy University System with its main campus enrollment of 6,998 students and the total enrollment of all Troy University campuses of 19,579. Troy University is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS) to award associate, baccalaureate, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees.
In August 2005, Troy State University, Beijing; Troy State University, Phenix City; Troy State University, Dothan; and Troy State University (Main Campus) all merged under one accreditation to become Troy University to better reflect the institution's worldwide mission. Prior to the merger, each campus was independently accredited and merging of these campuses helped to create a stronger institution by eliminating overlapping services and barriers to students. The merger combined talents and resources of staff, faculty, and administrators into a single highly effective and competitive university.
Today, the university serves the educational needs of students in four Alabama campuses, and 60 teaching sites in 17 U.S. States and 11 countries.

102553,University of Alaska Anchorage,Anchorage,99508,"https://www.alaska.edu/",default.png,"The University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) is a public research university located in Anchorage, Alaska. UAA also administers four community campuses spread across Southcentral Alaska. These include Kenai Peninsula College, Kodiak College, Matanuska–Susitna College, and Prince William Sound College. Between the community campuses and the main Anchorage campus, over 20,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students are currently enrolled at UAA. This makes it the largest institution of higher learning in the University of Alaska System, as well as the state.
UAA's main campus is located approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) southeast of its downtown area in the University-Medical District, adjacent to the Alaska Native Medical Center, Alaska Pacific University and Providence Alaska Medical Center. Nestled among an extensive green belt, close to scenic Goose Lake Park, UAA has been recognized each of the past three years as a Tree Campus USA by the Arbor Day Foundation. Much of the campus is connected by a network of paved, outdoor trails, as well as an elevated, indoor ""spine"" that extends east to west from Rasmuson Hall, continuing through the student union and across UAA Drive (the more heavily-traveled of the two north-south roads which bisect the campus) before terminating inside the Consortium Library.
UAA is divided into six teaching units at the Anchorage campus: the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business and Public Policy, the Community and Technical College, College of Education, College of Engineering and the College of Health. UAA offers master's degrees and graduate certificates in select programs, and the ability to complete certain PhD programs through cooperating universities through its Graduate Division.

Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.
Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering, managing $332 million in 2011 in sponsored research. Its 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi (18 km) northeast of downtown Los Angeles. First-year students are required to live on campus, and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus House System at Caltech. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks, student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division III's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
Caltech is frequently cited as one of the world's best universities. Caltech alumni and faculty include 34 Nobel Prizes (Linus Pauling being the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes), 1 Fields Medalist, 6 Turing Award winners, 4 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and 71 have won the United States National Medal of Science or Technology. There are 112 faculty members who have been elected to the United States National Academies. In addition, numerous faculty members are associated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as NASA. According to a 2015 Pomona College study, Caltech ranked number one in the U.S. for the percentage of its graduates who go on to earn a PhD.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,CA,2,8,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Csb,1,0,1,1,1,3,2,3,2,0,1,1,0.0642,740,760,790,800,750,795,35,36,35,36,35,36,36,36,36,1557,938,54600,54600,19794,105185,20595,0.9289,0.0439005359730625,0.5469,145040.833656203,138836.889931301,129420,68015.9088669897,181259,67501,191936.353793727,63804.3233333333,204209,10,151,1428,16644,2091,14631,4311,0.935703418619743,0.2697,0.0171,0.1716,0.3657,0.001,0.0011,0.0896,0.0842,0.0011,0.347826087,0.184782609,0.149538770905,0.103415504983333,0.27173913,3,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2656,0,0,0.3485,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0498,0.1037,0,0,0,0,0,0.2241,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0083,0,1,34.137349,-118.125878,0.595809138,-2.061685503,3.6,1,C,74970,74763,74970,66628,68328,64042,59296,23233,113577.075789459,5.21343541308659,3.86953974091433,5337.08727210341,1,3.62489723027229

It was incorporated in 1961 as the first degree-granting institution of higher learning in the United States created specifically for students of both the visual and the performing arts. It is authorized by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) to grant Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts in the visual, performing, and, since 1994, literary arts. The Herb Alpert School of Music at CalArts was accredited in 2009 to grant a Doctor of Musical Arts.
The school was first envisioned by many benefactors in the early 1960s, staffed by a diverse array of professionals (including Nelbert Murphy Chouinard, a founder of Chouinard Art Institute, Walt Disney, Lulu Von Hagen, Thornton Ladd and others).

It is one of the institutions of the contiguous Claremont Colleges, which share adjoining campus grounds. The college's mission is: ""Harvey Mudd College seeks to educate engineers, scientists, and mathematicians well versed in all of these areas and in the humanities and the social sciences so that they may assume leadership in their fields with a clear understanding of the impact of their work on society.""
Harvey Mudd College shares university resources such as libraries, dining halls, health services, and campus security, with the other institutions in the Claremont Colleges, including Pitzer College, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Pomona College, Claremont Graduate University, and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences, but each college is independently managed by its own faculty, board of trustees, and college endowment and has its own separate admissions process. Students at Harvey Mudd College are encouraged to take classes (acceptable for academic credit at Harvey Mudd College) at the other four undergraduate Claremont colleges, especially classes outside their major of study. Together the Claremont Colleges provide the resources and opportunities of a large university while enabling the specialization and personal attention afforded by the individual colleges. The Bachelor of Science diploma received at graduation is issued by Harvey Mudd College.
The college is named after Harvey Seeley Mudd, one of the initial investors in the Cyprus Mines Corporation. Although involved in the planning of the new institution, Mudd died before it opened.

Since becoming independent in 1990, LSU has won multiple national and world titles in the Enactus (formerly Students in Free Enterprise) competition. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, controversy arose involving the teaching of evolution in La Sierra's science curriculum. La Sierra has also been the subject of controversy due to its students' low CPA exam pass rates and high levels of student debt after graduation.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,CA,2,8,11,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,95,0,1,1,Csa,0,0,1,1,1,3,2,3,2,0,1,1,0.552,460,580,450,570,520,510,16,24,13,26,16,24,20,20,20,1034,1592,33570,33570,28743,8674,8123,0.3309,0.124162001850802,0.3926,55004,49424,40563,29378,78720,34927,85723,24948,67748,31,287,1971,8625,3717,15084,5631,0.487451792890841,0.1149,0.0729,0.5057,0.1639,0.0038,0.0082,0.0371,0.093,6e-04,0.39874739,0.1565762,0.14091858,0.115866388,0.187891441,13,0,0,0,0,0,0.0372,0,0.0133,0,0,0,0,0.0106,0,0,0.016,0.0293,0,0.109,0.0027,0,0.0053,0.109,0.0106,0,0,0,0.0399,0.1197,0.0612,0.0213,0,0,0,0,0.0585,0.1596,0.1755,0.0213,1,33.910704,-117.500054,0.591853436,-2.050762814,2.6,1,C,56256,47883,56256,25028,25178,22420,21090,15570,17844.9985236917,5.29027243467437,-0.0749241173384055,13334.594480845,6,-0.129676365925301

123961,University of Southern California,Los Angeles,90089,"https://www.usc.edu/",123961.png,"The University of Southern California (USC or SC) is a private research university founded in 1880 with its main campus in Los Angeles, California. As California's oldest private research university, USC has historically educated a large number of the region's business leaders and professionals. In recent decades, the university has also leveraged its location in Los Angeles to establish relationships with research and cultural institutions throughout Asia and the Pacific Rim. An engine for economic activity, USC contributes $8 billion annually to the economy of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and California.
For the 2014–15 academic year, there were 18,740 students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs. USC also has 23,729 graduate and professional students in a number of different programs, including business, law, engineering, social work, and medicine. The university is one of the top fundraising institutions in the world, consistently ranking among the top 3 in external contributions and alumni giving rates. Multiple academic rankings list the University of Southern California as being among the top 25 universities in the United States. With an acceptance rate of 16 percent, USC is also among the most selective academic institutions in the nation.
USC maintains a strong tradition of innovation and entrepreneurship, with alumni having founded companies such as Lucasfilm, Myspace, Salesforce.com, Intuit, Qualcomm, Box, Tinder, and Riot Games. As of 2014, the university has produced the fourth largest number of billionaire alumni out of all undergraduate institutions in the world.
USC is home to the world’s most powerful quantum computer, which is presently housed in a super-cooled, magnetically shielded facility at the USC Information Sciences Institute. The only other commercially available quantum computing system is operated jointly by NASA and Google. USC was also one of the earliest nodes on ARPANET and is the birthplace of the Domain Name System. Other technologies invented at USC include DNA computing, dynamic programming, image compression, VoIP, and antivirus software.
USC sponsors a variety of intercollegiate sports and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Pac-12 Conference. Members of the sports teams, the Trojans, have won 102 NCAA team championships, ranking them third in the nation, and 378 NCAA individual championships, ranking them second in the nation. Trojan athletes have won 288 medals at the Olympic games (135 golds, 88 silvers and 65 bronzes), more than any other university in the United States. If USC were a country, its athletes would have collectively received the 12th-most Olympic gold medals in history.

130794,Yale University,New Haven,6520,"https://www.yale.edu/",130794.png,"Yale University is an American private Ivy League research university in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in 1701 in Saybrook Colony to train Congregationalist ministers, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.
The ""Collegiate School"" moved to New Haven in 1716, and shortly after was renamed Yale College in recognition of a gift from British East India Company governor Elihu Yale. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century the school introduced graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.
Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, including the Yale Bowl, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forest and nature preserves throughout New England. The university's assets include an endowment valued at $25.4 billion as of June 2016, the second largest of any U.S. educational institution. The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.
Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and are organized into a social system of residential colleges. Almost all faculty teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. Students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League.
Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 20 living billionaires, and many heads of state. In addition, Yale has graduated hundreds of members of Congress and many high-level U.S. diplomats. 52 Nobel laureates, 5 Fields Medalists, 247 Rhodes Scholars, and 119 Marshall Scholars have been affiliated with the University.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,CT,2,1,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,1,1,1,0.0608,720,770,740,800,745,770,33,35,35,36,31,35,34,36,33,1517,6089,55500,55500,18096,57231,19830,0.717,0.0337746740845938,0.4919,88655,75144,72046,47968,132539,60311,146102,41296,117746,76,886,1050,16600,3495,14258.0833333333,2943.79833333333,0.97200012293066,0.404,0.076,0.1412,0.2005,0.0048,0.001,0.0652,0.102,0.0053,0.317373461,0.205198358,0.14500684,0.080711354,0.251709986,6,80,0,0.0163,0.0127,0.0524,0,0,0.0701,0,0,0.0722,0,0.0234,0,0,0.0304,0.0092,0,0.1189,0.0616,0,0.0708,0,0.017,0,0.0403,0,0.0453,0,0,0.2371,0,0,0,0,0.0481,0,0,0.0743,1,41.311158,-72.926688,0.721015725,-1.272810818,3.7,1,C,73751.8816666667,76645,73751.8816666667,71775,72253,71733,62408,30483,64496.3063191298,5.42225949345285,2.87323809804547,1293.84134508751,1,3.65999901523072

The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown. It is medium-sized – approximately 18,500 undergraduate and 4,500 graduate students. UD is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land-grant, sea-grant, space-grant and urban-grant state-supported research institution.
UD is classified as a research university with very high research activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The university's programs in engineering, science, business, hospitality management, education, urban affairs and public policy, public administration, agriculture, history, chemical and biomolecular engineering, chemistry and biochemistry have been highly ranked with some drawing from the historically strong presence of the nation's chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the state of Delaware, such as DuPont and W. L. Gore and Associates. It is one of only four schools in North America with a major in art conservation. In 1923, UD was the first American university to offer a study abroad program.
The school from which the university grew was founded in 1743, making it one of the oldest in the nation. However, UD was not chartered as an institution of higher learning until 1833.

It is a pontifical university of the Catholic Church in the United States and the only institution of higher education founded by the U.S. Catholic bishops. Established in 1887 as a graduate and research center following approval by Pope Leo XIII on Easter Sunday, the university began offering undergraduate education in 1904. The university's campus lies within the Brookland neighborhood, known as ""Little Rome"", which contains 60 Catholic institutions, including Trinity Washington University and the Dominican House of Studies.
It has been ranked as one of the nation's best colleges by the Princeton Review, one of the best values of any private school in the country by Kiplinger's, ""one of the most eco-friendly universities in the country,"" and was awarded the ""highest federal recognition an institution can receive"" for community service. In addition, it was ranked in the top 10 of the best Catholic colleges in the country, and has been recommended by the Cardinal Newman Society in The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College. It was described as one of the 25 most underrated colleges in the United States.
CUA's programs emphasize the liberal arts, professional education, and personal development. The school stays closely connected with the Catholic Church and Catholic organizations. The American Cardinals Dinner is put on by the residential U.S. cardinals each year to raise scholarship funds for CUA. The university has a long history of working with the Knights of Columbus; the university's law school and basilica have dedications to the involvement and support of the Knights.
The university has been visited three times by sitting popes. Pope John Paul II visited on October 7, 1979. On April 16, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI gave an address at the campus about Catholic education and academic freedom. Pope Francis visited on September 23, 2015 during his trip to the United States, where he celebrated Mass on the east portico of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,DC,2,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,3,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,1,1,0.8536,541.88,640.643333333333,532.598333333333,636.565,592.236666666667,585.286666666667,22.175,28.14,21.6433333333333,29.255,20.7266666666667,27.1216666666667,25.3916666666667,25.825,24.19,1192.28666666667,3245,47746,47746,23012,19610,10213,0.5427,0.0746243956717782,0.4518,71804,61433,55801,40732,85270,48210,95724,34956,73659,69,889,1000,15260,3150,15260,3150,0.724860708968651,0.67,0.0419,0.1418,0.0336,0.0018,3e-04,0.0428,0.0468,0.021,0.127917834,0.079365079,0.109243698,0.153127918,0.530345472,10,46.1,0,0,0.0667,0,0.0359,0,0.0205,0,0.0269,0.1179,0,0.0051,0,0,0.0103,0.0051,0,0.0205,0.0115,0,0.0013,0,0.0538,0,0.0051,0,0.0795,0,0.0269,0.1231,0,0,0,0,0.0551,0.0936,0.2167,0.0244,1,38.933651,-76.997909,0.6795204,-1.343867029,3,1,C,67156,67156,67156,37964,37428,34873,29893,25690,37534.6865369634,4.23069398639958,0.508911109756541,9847.12888952644,5,0.359393635544681

GW is the largest institution of higher education in Washington, D.C.
George Washington, the first U.S. president, advocated the establishment of a centrally located national university in his first State of the Union address in 1790 and continued to promote this idea throughout his career. In his will, Washington left his 50 shares in the Potomac Company to help endow the university. However, due to the company's financial difficulties, the funding did not materialize. The university was chartered by an act of Congress on February 9, 1821, as Columbian College. Its name was changed to Columbian University in 1873 and to the George Washington University in 1904, in honor of Washington.
The university has ten colleges and schools: the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences (which includes the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, the School of Media and Public Affairs, and the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration); the School of Business, the Elliott School of International Affairs, the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the College of Professional Studies (which includes the Graduate School of Political Management), the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences, the Law School, the School of Nursing, and the Graduate School of Education and Human Development.
GW's Graduate School of Political Management is the only school of applied politics in the nation's capital. GW's professional schools and the Elliott School of International Affairs are consistently ranked highly in national and international college rankings lists.
The Princeton Review consistently ranks GW as one of the ""Most Politically Active"" schools. Some of the university's graduates have gone on to high positions within both the U.S. government and foreign governments.

Founded in 1789 as Georgetown College, the university has since grown to incorporate nine undergraduate and graduate schools, including the School of Foreign Service, School of Business, a Medical Center and a Law School. Georgetown's main campus is located on a hill above the Potomac River. It is recognizable by its flagship Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark that towers over Washington's Georgetown neighborhood.
Georgetown offers degree programs in forty-eight disciplines, enrolling an average of 7,500 undergraduate and 10,000 post-graduate students from more than 130 countries. The university is especially known for preparing leaders for careers in government and international affairs. As of 2015, Georgetown produced more diplomats for the U.S. Foreign Service than any other school in the country, and has ranked second in the U.S. by the average number of graduates serving in the U.S. Congress. Georgetown's notable alumni include U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, CIA Director George Tenet, actor Bradley Cooper, King Felipe VI of Spain, as well as the royalty and heads of state of more than a dozen countries.
Georgetown is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit-affiliated institution of higher education in the United States. The Jesuits have participated in the university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805; however, the university has always been governed independently of the church.

133809,Florida College,Temple Terrace,33617,"https://www.floridacollege.edu/",default.png,"Florida College is a small, regionally accredited, coeducational Christian college located in the City of Temple Terrace, Florida, eight miles (13 km) northeast of the City of Tampa, Florida. Degree programs include the Bachelor of Science in Biblical Education, the Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies, the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, the Bachelor of Arts in Communication, the Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education, the Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, the Bachelor of Arts in Music, as well as an Associate of Arts degree.
Since its founding as a junior college in 1946, Florida College has drawn its staff, faculty, and the majority of its students from non-institutional churches of Christ. It is also recognized among these churches as an important training center for ministers. Because non-institutional churches of Christ, as a matter of doctrine, oppose congregational support for colleges, Florida College has some unique characteristics as religious colleges go – the college accepts no direct contributions from any congregation or other organized religious body, and its board members serve as individuals rather than as official representatives of any such entity.
The high emphasis Florida College places on its Christian heritage is expressed in its tradition of daily chapel services. All members of the board of directors and all faculty members are required to be active members in a Church of Christ. All students are required to receive daily classes in biblical topics.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,FL,2,5,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,0,0,1,0,1,3,4,1,4,0,1,0,0.7534,490,640,480,580,565,530,20,27,20,28,18,26,24,24,22,1141,537,17300,17300,18219,11416,7253,0.7818,0.0719363972613291,0.4823,46968,40513,33351,26651,60276,27170,67193,19170,46072,5,93,1300,8690,3200,10000,3200,0.519081412079738,0.7765,0.0503,0.0857,0.0149,0.0037,0.0019,0.0391,0.0168,0.0112,0.20979021,0.115384615,0.223776224,0.195804196,0.255244755,13,50,0,0,0,0.0079,0.0794,0,0,0,0.0873,0,0,0,0,0,0.0317,0.5714,0,0,0,0,0,0.0079,0,0.0079,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0238,0.0397,0.1349,0.0079,1,28.034936,-82.383289,0.489301939,-1.437859642,2.7,2,C,31800,30490,31800,14738,14336,12104,7379,5064,16428.6247776249,3.46809866816,0.0137348579989344,10287.1589499707,6,-0.0371352506496503

Seminole State is the eighth-largest member institution of the Florida College System.
Founded in 1965, the Florida State Legislature signed a charter creating ""Seminole Junior College."" The college opened in August 1966 with 700 students at a former citrus grove in Seminole County, near U.S. Route 17/92 and County Road 427 (Ronald Reagan Blvd.) now in the city of Sanford. By October 1971, Seminole Junior College's enrollment had exceeded 7,000, and by 1975, Seminole Junior College became ""Seminole Community College"", with enrollment reaching 14,161. In 2006, Seminole Community College partnered with the University of Central Florida to launch ""DirectConnect to UCF"", which guarantees Seminole Community College (SCC) graduates admission to the university, as well as academic advising by university counselors. In September 2009, the SCC Board of Trustees unanimously approved a motion to rename the institution ""Seminole State College of Florida,"" eight months after the introduction of the institution's first state-approved bachelor's degree program, the Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.) in interior design.
As of 2011, the college serves over 30,000 students, full-time and part-time, and is also one of the largest employers in Seminole County. The college has expanded into four campuses since 1965, all based within Seminole County, Florida. Its main campus is located in Sanford, and its satellite campuses are located in Oviedo, Altamonte Springs and Heathrow. The Oviedo campus opened in 2001, the Heathrow in 2007, and the Altamonte Springs in 2008.

138187,Valencia College,Orlando,32835,"https://www.valenciacollege.edu/",default.png,"Valencia College is a public state college in Orlando, Florida, United States. In 2011, it was named the top community college in the United States by the Aspen Institute.
The college was founded in 1967 as ""Valencia Junior College,"" taking the name ""Valencia Community College"" in 1971. In December 2010, Valencia's Board of Trustees voted to change the name to ""Valencia College,"" because the academic scope of the school had expanded to include bachelor's degrees. Valencia has several campus locations in Orlando with additional campus locations in Winter Park and Kissimmee. Valencia is ranked first in the United States for the number of associate's degrees.

144050,University of Chicago,Chicago,60637,"https://www.uchicago.edu/",144050.jpg,"The University of Chicago (U of C, Chicago, or UChicago) is a private research university in Chicago, Illinois. It is highly ranked in numerous rankings and measures.
The university, established in 1890, is composed of the College, various graduate programs, and interdisciplinary committees organized into five academic research divisions and seven professional schools. Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago is also well known for its professional schools, which include the Pritzker School of Medicine, the Booth School of Business, the Law School, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, the Divinity School and the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. The university currently enrolls approximately 5,700 students in the College and around 15,000 students overall.
University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics; the Chicago school of sociology; law and economics theory in legal analysis; the Chicago school of literary criticism; the Chicago school of religion; and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction (Chicago Pile-1) beneath the viewing stands of university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.
Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and widely considered the wealthiest American in history John D. Rockefeller, the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890; William Rainey Harper became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892. Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility. With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities, an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.
The University of Chicago has many prominent alumni. 92 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the university as professors, students, faculty, or staff, the fourth most of any institution in the world. Similarly, 34 faculty members and 16 alumni have been awarded the MacArthur “Genius Grant”. In addition, Chicago's alumni include 50 Rhodes Scholars, 22 Marshall Scholars, 9 Fields Medalists, 20 National Humanities Medalists, 13 billionaire graduates, and a plethora of members of the United States Congress and heads of state of countries all over the world.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,IL,2,3,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,5,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1,0.0617,730,770,770,800,750,785,33,35,35,36,31,35,34,36,33,1528,6801,60552,60552,30967,85108,18547,0.8195,0.0284661559632719,0.5114,76730,68397,62671,42289,111040,51584,125653,36543,101041,80,1300,1800,17004,2175,14908.7583333333,2698.61333333333,0.947301542622792,0.3742,0.0559,0.1432,0.1888,7e-04,3e-04,0.0695,0.1456,0.0218,0.319648094,0.173020528,0.123167155,0.058651026,0.325513197,5,75,0,0.0118,0,0.0039,0,0,0.0539,0,0,0.0145,0,0.0388,0,0,0.0408,0.0125,0,0.0901,0.1125,0,7e-04,0,0.0414,0.002,0.0684,0,0.0474,0,0.077,0.3217,0,0,0,0,0.0283,0,0,0.0342,1,41.787994,-87.599539,0.729338083,-1.528900379,3.6,1,D,79959.3716666667,81531,79959.3716666667,75843,75755,70621,60626,35399,55926.6923703093,5.55799488064442,3.15174659251268,2118.26140617272,1,3.54727103370879

152080,University of Notre Dame,Notre Dame,46556,"https://www.nd.edu/",152080.png,"The University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame /ˌnoʊtərˈdeɪm/ NOH-tər-DAYM) is a Catholic research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United States. In French, Notre Dame du Lac means ""Our Lady of the Lake"" and refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary. The main campus covers 1,250 acres (5,100,000 m2) in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks, such as the Golden Dome, the ""Word of Life"" mural (commonly known as Touchdown Jesus), and the Basilica. The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president, as an all-male institution on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes (Indiana). Today, many Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including the president of the university.
Notre Dame is a large, four-year, highly residential research university. It is consistently ranked among the top twenty universities in the United States and as a major global university and is highly regarded for its undergraduate education. Notre Dame is also ranked as one of the top research universities and it has one of the largest endowments in the nation with over $10 billion. Undergraduate students are organized into four colleges (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business), and the Architecture School. The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.
The university offers over 50 foreign study abroad yearlong programs and over 15 summer programs. Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master, doctoral and professional degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and scientific museums, including the Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of Art. The university boasts one of the largest Navy ROTC programs in the nation. Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events, and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni, considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.
Notre Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish football team under the guidance of legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent with no conference affiliation, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame, 13 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is one of the most famed and successful college football teams in history. Other ND sport teams, chiefly in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships. The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable collegiate fight song.
Started as a small all-male institution in 1842 and charter in 1844, Notre Dame reached international fame at the beginning of the 20th century. Major improvements to the university occurred during the administration of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh between 1952 and 1987 as Hesburgh's administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic programs, and reputation and first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972. Ever since, the University has seen steady growth, and under the leadership of the next two presidents, Rev. Malloy and Rev. Jenkins, many infrastructure and research expansions have been completed.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,IN,2,3,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,1,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,1,1,0.1583,680,760,720,790,720,755,32,35,33.0083333333333,35.3033333333333,29.9166666666667,34.5566666666667,34,34.4383333333333,32.7583333333333,1490,8689,55553,55553,25579,32634,14604,0.903,0.032114069466646,0.5212,88962,80006,76123,57082,116194,59531,131654,49003,100369,81,1855,1050,15640,1950,15640,1950,0.958800576252451,0.6738,0.0363,0.1151,0.046,0.0021,0.001,0.0549,0.0611,0.0097,0.146936347,0.085068412,0.111243308,0.123735872,0.533016062,9,75,0,0.0082,0.0139,0.0159,0,0,0.0577,0,5e-04,0.1663,0,0.0072,0,0,0.0216,0.0178,0,0.0962,0.0274,0,0.0399,0,0.0063,0.0091,0.0183,0,0.0337,0,0,0.1351,0,0,0,0,0.0442,0.0216,0.249,0.0101,2,41.703058,-86.238959,0.72785567,-1.505153778,3.5,2,D,74193,74193,74193,59282,56171,54012,47388,27233,69933.0939946029,4.06989888224263,1.65912630281822,2011.50938768729,2,3.12860693089597
152099,Oakland City University,Oakland City,47660-1099,"https://www.oak.edu/",default.png,"Oakland City University, abbreviated as OCU, is a coeducational, small-town, private university in Oakland City in eastern Gibson County, about 25 miles (40 km) north and slightly east of Evansville in Southwestern Indiana, United States. Oakland City University is the only General Baptist Church-affiliated college in the United States. Its founding was in 1885; it has slowly grown to the present student enrollment of about 120 on the main campus and, counting all sites, about 2,000 total. OCU's teams, called the Oaks, play in the NCCAA (National Christian College Athletic Association) and NCAA Division II, where they are strong and have won many CCNIT national titles over the years.
In addition to the institution's Oakland City Main Campus, the university has satellite campuses in Indianapolis, Evansville, Rockport and Bedford where they hold classes for busy adults. The Bedford branch is housed in the former headquarters of the Indiana Limestone Company. These sites utilize the adult learning model that emphasizes experiential application to objectives and theory. Students from a wide age range attend, learning from three sources: the texts, their instructors (who work in the field they teach), and from each other. Courses are provided in an accelerated pace and condensed format, much like how summer school operates in more traditional programs. Students may take one or two courses at a time and enroll as full-time. They focus on learning business techniques and communication skills which build stronger career skills that can easily be translated to working situations.

The university is a coed, four-year, private institution that enrolls about 4,500 students from over 50 countries on a campus of 350 acres (140 ha).
Valpo consists of five undergraduate colleges, a graduate school, and a law school. It is the largest independent Lutheran university in the United States and is home to the second-largest collegiate chapel in the world, the Chapel of the Resurrection.
Originally named Valparaiso Male and Female College, Valparaiso University was founded in 1859 as one of the first coeducation colleges in the United States. Due to reverses brought about by the Civil War, the college was forced to close its doors in 1871. Two years later it was revived by educator Henry Baker Brown and named Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute. At the turn of the 20th century, Brown changed the college's name to Valparaiso College, and shortly after it was rechartered as Valparaiso University. Initially founded by Methodists, in 1925 the school was purchased by the Lutheran University Association, which continues to operate it today.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,IN,2,3,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,1,1,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1,0.8585,540,640,530,650,590,590,22,29,21,29,22,28,26,25,25,1202,2965,41820,41820,14808,10903,7866,0.7511,0.0752318814463692,0.4422,55837,51170,47544,33521,75003,36837,78491,33216,65996,39,1039,1200,12260,1620,8900,1620,0.714841183763977,0.7228,0.0536,0.1089,0.0223,0.0013,3e-04,0.0317,0.0317,0.0273,0.246464647,0.111784512,0.153535354,0.17979798,0.308417508,10,0,0,0.0051,0,0.0013,0.0485,0,0.0268,0,0.0612,0.1594,0,0.0051,0,0,0.0166,0,0,0.0319,0.0115,0,0.0153,0.0242,0,0.0077,0.0434,0,0.0434,0,0.0204,0.0561,0,0,0,0,0.023,0.236,0.1531,0.0102,1,41.462239,-87.040172,0.723652586,-1.519137583,3,2,D,53540,56900,53540,38319,36994,34246,30696,27397,32756.8452701935,3.92654266378712,0.0248712054954096,8695.55981970359,5,0.378288089546414

153001,Buena Vista University,Storm Lake,50588,"https://www.bvu.edu/",153001.jpg,"Buena Vista University is a private four-year college located in Storm Lake, Iowa. Founded in 1891 as Buena Vista College, it is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. The university's 60-acre (240,000 m2) campus is situated on the shores of Storm Lake, a 3,200-acre (13 km2) natural lake. BVU's academic programs feature a balance between traditional liberal arts courses and hands-on learning opportunities, such as travel and internships. The average student-to-professor ratio is 13:1.
At its inception, the college was housed in the Storm Lake Opera House, where it remained for only a year. Old Main, the college's first building, opened in 1892, and was occupied by faculty and students until it burned down in 1956. Major construction projects in the 1950s and 1960s extended the college, which soon included three dormitories, a library, and a number of classroom buildings.
The college gained accreditation in 1952, and began to grant degrees under the authority of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The first graduate degrees were offered in 1995, at which time the college became Buena Vista University.
The main campus of Buena Vista University offers a 4-year residential collegiate experience and currently offers classes in 42 majors. Seventeen additional locations throughout Iowa and online serve working adult and graduate students as part of the Graduate &amp; Professional Studies program.

157100,Kentucky Christian University,Grayson,41143-1199,"https://www.kcu.edu/",default.png,"Kentucky Christian University (KCU) is a comprehensive baccalaureate level Christian university located in Grayson, Kentucky. It was founded on December 1, 1919, as Christian Normal Institute, by J. W. Lusby and J. O. Snodgrass. As a ""normal school"" its programs included a high school, a junior college, and a training program for public school teachers. During the early 1920s its emphasis shifted to educating students for the Christian ministry. Degree programs are offered in eight schools within the university: the School of Art and Science, the Sack School of Bible and Ministry, the School of Business, the Keeran School of Education, the School of Music, the Yancy School of Nursing, the School of Social Work and Human Services, and the Graduate School.
KCU is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is authorized to award bachelor's and master's degrees. All programs requiring professional licensure (i.e. Nursing, Social Work, and Teacher Education) are professionally accredited.
Every graduate of KCU takes a 24-hour core in Biblical Studies, in addition to the liberal arts core and the student's major area of study (social work, education, ministry, etc.) This combination of biblical studies, liberal arts, and professional studies is a feature unique to Kentucky Christian University. It is the rationale for KCU's self-designation as ""The Great Commission University.""
Twice weekly mandatory chapel services are an important part of the KCU experience and contribute to a sense of community on campus. The university is also well known for the magnitude of their worship leaders, their Christian nursing program, and athletic programs (football, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, women's volleyball.) The University Concert Choir has produced several albums and performs nationally and internationally; however, in order to accommodate a growing athletic budget, the choral program (as well as the entire School of Music) has been removed from the school's offered programs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,KY,2,5,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,1,1,Cfa,0,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,1,1,0.4035,410,500,412,510,455,461,17,21,15,21,16,21,19,18,19,1004,539,20596,20596,9063,4880,4806,0.3187,0.105844330777183,0.6085,38662,35500,35322,23804,48601,25651,53438,23023,49515,1,86,1200,8480,4900,8480,11170,0.382860024148168,0.666,0.1763,0.0575,0.0019,0.0056,0.001,0.026,0.039,0.0278,0.369281046,0.147058824,0.176470588,0.166666667,0.140522876,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1412,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0471,0,0,0.0824,0,0,0.0471,0,0,0.0588,0,0.0941,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3294,0.1647,0.0353,1,38.338805,-82.945561,0.669138379,-1.447673139,2.7,3,C,41446,35176,41446,15464,11700,12675,12553,10947,13367.9406031574,4.08720435869803,-0.794453184348319,13981.1853114469,5,0.187491394247652

Louisiana Tech opened as the Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana in 1894 during the Second Industrial Revolution. The original mission of the college was for the education of students in the arts and sciences for the purpose of developing an industrial economy in post-Reconstruction Louisiana. Four years later in 1898, the state constitution changed the school's name to Louisiana Industrial Institute. In 1921, the college changed its name to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute to reflect its evolution into a larger and more capable institute of technology. Under the leadership of Dr. F. Jay Taylor, the college continued to grow and change over time. Louisiana Polytechnic Institute became desegregated in the 1960s and officially changed its name to Louisiana Tech University in 1970 as the school developed into a research university.
Louisiana Tech enrolled 12,694 students in five academic colleges during the Fall 2016 academic quarter including 1,400 students in the graduate school. In addition to the main campus in Ruston, Louisiana Tech holds classes at the Louisiana Tech University Shreveport Center, Cyber Innovation Center in Bossier City, Barksdale Air Force Base, and on the CenturyLink campus in Monroe.

USM's three primary campuses are located in Portland, Gorham and Lewiston in the U.S. state of Maine. Many courses and degree programs are also offered online. It was founded as two separate state universities, Gorham Normal School and University of Maine at Portland. The two universities were combined in 1970 to help streamline the public university system in Maine and eventually expanded by adding the Lewiston campus in 1988.
The Portland Campus is home to the Edmund Muskie School of Public Service, the Bio Sciences Research Institute, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and the Osher Map Library, and the USM School of Business. The Gorham campus, much more residential, is home to the School of Education and Human Development and the School of Music. MeMUNC is hosted here every year.
USM is among the ""Best Northeastern Colleges,"" according to the Princeton Review's 2007 listings, and was also included in its 2007 edition of ""America's Best Value Colleges.""

Established in 1893 by the Potomac Synod of the Reformed Church of the United States as the Woman's College of Frederick, the school was officially chartered in 1897 ""with the purpose and object of creating and maintaining a college for the promotion and advancement of women, and the cultivation and diffusion of Literature, Science and Art."" The college's founding was the result of the Potomac Synod's decision to transition the coeducational Mercersburg College into the all-male Mercersburg Academy and establish a women's college south of the Mason–Dixon line. In 1913, the institution was renamed Hood College by its Board of Trustees to honor its most generous benefactor, Margaret Scholl Hood, whose land donation allowed the school to move from rented facilities in downtown Frederick to its own campus in the northwest region of the city.
An all-female institution until 1971, the college initially admitted men only as commuters. This continued until 2003, when male students were extended the option of residential status. The influx of new students has led to major changes at the school, including extensive dormitory renovations, and the construction of a new athletic building and a new tennis and aquatic center.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,MD,2,2,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,2,Cfa,1,0,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,1,1,0.6533,514.908333333333,617.08,507.878333333333,604.695,567.143333333333,557.833333333333,19.9366666666667,25.92,19.4733333333333,25.945,18.275,25.4716666666667,23.1683333333333,22.8916666666667,22.0566666666667,1132.63,1106,41060,41060,15503,10888,7820,0.4215,0.125050779062545,0.3707,51779,45129,41188,27745,63505,35174,70509,27162,54543,21,478,1248,12880,3262,12066,3262,0.650754154086785,0.5769,0.1763,0.1203,0.0362,9e-04,9e-04,0.0552,0.0172,0.0163,0.31965812,0.147008547,0.15042735,0.135042735,0.247863248,10,0,0,0.0308,0,0.0038,0.0846,0,0.0385,0,0.0808,0,0,0.0154,0,0,0.0308,0,0,0.1192,0.0308,0,0.0154,0,0,0,0.0077,0,0.0885,0.0731,0.0385,0.0385,0,0,0,0,0.0192,0.0923,0.1538,0.0385,1,39.420631,-77.419049,0.688019804,-1.351217309,2.6,1,C,57636,58450,57636,40658,39771,33512,25309,21605,25675.2691044001,4.81583582765066,-0.127588031909011,9226.07498156174,6,-0.0279764502717846
162928,Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,21218-2688,"https://www.jhu.edu/",162928.jpg,"The Johns Hopkins University (commonly referred to as Johns Hopkins, JHU, or simply Hopkins) is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His $7 million bequest—of which half financed the establishment of The Johns Hopkins Hospital—was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States.
Johns Hopkins is organized into 10 divisions on campuses in Maryland and Washington, D.C. with international centers in Italy, China, and Singapore. The two undergraduate divisions, the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and the Whiting School of Engineering, are located on the Homewood campus in Baltimore's Charles Village neighborhood. The medical school, the nursing school, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health are located on the Medical Institutions campus in East Baltimore. The university also consists of the Peabody Institute, the Applied Physics Laboratory, the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, the School of Education, the Carey Business School, and various other facilities.
Johns Hopkins was a founding member of the American Association of Universities.

164465,Amherst College,Amherst,01002-5000,"https://www.amherst.edu/",164465.jpg,"Amherst College (/ˈæmərst/ AM-ərst) is a private liberal arts college located in Amherst, Massachusetts, United States. Founded in 1821 as an attempt to relocate Williams College by its president, Zephaniah Swift Moore, Amherst is the third oldest institution of higher education in Massachusetts. The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after Lord Jeffery Amherst. Amherst was established as a men's college and became coeducational in 1975.
Amherst is an exclusively undergraduate four-year institution and enrolled 1,849 students in the fall of 2016. Students choose courses from 38 major programs in an open curriculum. Students are not required to study a core curriculum or fulfill any distribution requirements and may even design their own unique interdisciplinary major. Freshmen may take advanced courses, and seniors may take introductory ones. For the class of 2020, Amherst received 8,406 applications and accepted 1,161 yielding a 13.8% acceptance rate. Amherst was ranked as the second best liberal arts college in the country by U.S. News &amp; World Report, and 12th out of all U.S. colleges and universities by Forbes in their 2016 rankings. Amherst competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference.
Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries with Williams College and Wesleyan University which form the Little Three colleges. The college is a member of the Five College Consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four other Pioneer Valley institutions. These include Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,MA,2,1,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfb,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,1,0,0.1131,650,740,660,780,695,720,30,34,31,35,27,34,32,33,31,1431,1839,58640,58640,28385,32689,12949,0.922,0.0477449324639729,0.4976,79492.4676922989,76309,54333,40980,117651,46552,125508.009363112,25476,96433,29,312,1000,15310,1800,15310,1800,0.954900827424155,0.4328,0.1017,0.1316,0.1479,0.0049,0.0011,0.0653,0.0881,0.0266,0.320113314,0.212464589,0.144475921,0.079320113,0.243626062,7,60,0,0.0498,0.0062,0.0622,0,0,0.0975,0,0,0,0,0.0519,0,0.0166,0.0622,0,0,0.1369,0.0851,0,0.0062,0,0.0083,0,0.0373,0,0.0602,0,0,0.2199,0,0,0,0,0.0498,0,0,0.0498,1,42.372459,-72.518493,0.739538922,-1.265686471,3.5,2,D,76750,76750,76750,67887,69543,65747,49773,28266,47470.3211636605,5.58217369474349,1.31970797314118,1571.6190559315,2,3.04083972684198

Founded in 1887 with a large endowment from its namesake Jonas Gilman Clark, a prominent businessman, Clark was one of the first modern research universities in the United States. Originally an all-graduate institution, Clark's first undergraduates entered in 1902. The university now offers 46 majors, minors, and concentrations in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering and allows students to design specialized majors and engage in pre-professional programs. It is noted for its programs in the fields of psychology, geography, physics, biology, and entrepreneurship and is a member of the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts which enables students to cross-register to attend courses at other area institutions including Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the College of the Holy Cross. As a liberal arts-based research university, Clark makes substantial research opportunities available to its students, notably at the undergraduate level through LEEP project funding, yet is also respected for its intimate environment as the second smallest university counted among the top 75 national universities by U.S. News &amp; World Report and as one of 40 Colleges That Change Lives.
Graduate and professional programs are offered through the Graduate School, the Graduate School of Management, the Graduate School of Geography, the Frances L. Hiatt School of Psychology, the Gustaf H. Carlson School of Chemistry, the Adam Institute for Urban Teaching and School Practice, the International Development, Community and Environment Department, and the School of Professional Studies.
The university competes intercollegiately in 17 NCAA Division III varsity sports as the Clark Cougars and is a part of the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference. Intramural and club sports are also offered in a wide range of activities.

Together they are now known as the Five Colleges, or the Five College Consortium.
The college is widely known for its alternative curriculum, socially liberal politics, focus on portfolios rather than distribution requirements, and reliance on narrative evaluations instead of grades and GPAs. In some fields, it is among the top undergraduate institutions in percentage of graduates who enroll in graduate school. Fifty-six percent of its alumni have at least one graduate degree and it is ranked 30th among all U.S. colleges in the percentage of its graduates who go on to attain a doctorate degree (notably first among history doctorates).",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,MA,2,1,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,3,Dfb,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,1,3,1,1,0,0.0197,560.63,666.071666666667,533.716666666667,654.803333333333,613.756666666667,593.736666666667,22.9108333333333,29.1416666666667,22.8183333333333,30.9866666666667,20.6666666666667,27.185,26.215,27.175,24.29,1223.50833333333,745,52068,52068,21894,13958,9320,0.6552,0.0800115945386938,0.3852,41407,39692,28187,18208,59119,20359,62746,15924,43215,28,344,850,14120,1050,12120,1050,0.633326586880433,0.6013,0.0832,0.1181,0.0309,0.0013,0.001,0.0483,0.0564,0.0604,0.270547945,0.136986301,0.176369863,0.193493151,0.22260274,13,0,0.0208,0.0069,0.0174,0.0486,0.0278,0,0.066,0,0.059,0,0,0.0174,0,0.0139,0.066,0,0,0.0625,0,0,0.0139,0.0069,0.0208,0,0.0243,0,0.0556,0,0,0.0799,0,0,0,0,0.3125,0.0313,0.0174,0.0313,1,42.325852,-72.531469,0.738725476,-1.265912945,2.9,2,D,66088,68088,66088,46021,43049,43510,37309,25560,16507.9094556806,4.82634376029317,0.374787283206561,6628.92802008191,3,1.76396956081226
166027,Harvard University,Cambridge,2138,"https://www.harvard.edu/",166027.jfif,"Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636, whose history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities.
Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.
The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's $34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution.
Harvard is a large, highly residential research university. The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the University's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages. It operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums, alongside the Harvard Library, which is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes.

Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin.
The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. For several years, MIT's School of Engineering has been ranked first in various international and national university rankings, and the Institute is also often ranked among the world's top universities overall. The ""Engineers"" compete in 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.
As of 2015, 85 Nobel laureates, 52 National Medal of Science recipients, 65 Marshall Scholars, 45 Rhodes Scholars, 38 MacArthur Fellows, 34 astronauts, 19 Turing award winners, 16 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and 6 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT.

The university's sports teams, the Northeastern Huskies, compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) in 18 varsity sports. The men's and women's hockey teams compete in Hockey East, while the men's and women's rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC) and Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges (EAWRC), respectively. Men's Track and Field has won the CAA back to back years in 2015 and 2016. In 2013, men's basketball won its first CAA regular season championship, men's soccer won the CAA title for the first time, and women's ice hockey won a record 16th Beanpot championship.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,MA,2,1,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfa,1,0,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,1,1,1,0.1805,680,750,710,790,715,750,32,35,33,35,30,35,34,34,33,1478,14034,53506,53506,39441,18675,13482,0.7479,0.0467189460928549,0.4854,79786,76288,65632,49269,108675,52875,112386,42410,88776,188,3844,1000,16930,1800,16930,1800,0.891228017779791,0.4449,0.041,0.0861,0.1446,4e-04,1e-04,0.0493,0.1719,0.0616,0.22276085,0.126038781,0.120498615,0.144506002,0.386195753,14,75,0,0.0157,0.0115,5e-04,0.0448,0,0.0641,0,0,0.1973,0,0.0037,0,0,0.0064,5e-04,0,0.0886,0.0201,0,0,0,0.0012,0,0.0142,0,0.0313,0.0105,0.0054,0.1011,0,0,0,0,0.0306,0.1043,0.2446,0.0037,1,42.339992,-71.088782,0.738972266,-1.240733307,3.5,1,D,73236,73236,73236,60326,57742,52873,44821,27182,55765.7214778465,5.44457508932257,1.27207168651187,4578.75818878141,2,3.05584693847498

Tufts College was founded in 1852 by Christian Universalists who worked for years to open a nonsectarian institution of higher learning. Charles Tufts donated the land for the campus on Walnut Hill, the highest point in Medford, saying that he wanted to set a ""light on the hill"". The name was changed to Tufts University in 1954, although the corporate name remains ""the Trustees of Tufts College"". For more than a century, Tufts was a small New England liberal arts college. French American nutritionist and former professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, Jean Mayer, became president of Tufts in the late 1970s and, through a series of rapid acquisitions, transformed the school into a larger research university.
The university is organized into ten schools, including two undergraduate degree programs and eight graduate divisions, on four campuses in the Boston metropolitan area and the French Alps. The university emphasizes active citizenship and public service in all of its disciplines and is known for its internationalism and study abroad programs. Among its schools is the United States' oldest graduate school of international relations, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. The School of the Museum of Fine Arts offers art programs affiliated with a major museum, the Museum of Fine Arts. The university maintains a campus in Downtown Boston which houses the medical, dental, and nutrition schools, affiliated with several medical centers in the area. The university offers joint undergraduate degree programs with the New England Conservatory, and the Sciences Po Paris with additional programs with the University of Paris, University of Oxford and constituents of the University of London. Some of its programs have affiliations with the nearby institutions of Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

175227,Dunwoody College of Technology,Minneapolis,55403-1192,"https://www.dunwoody.edu/",175227.jpg,"Dunwoody College of Technology is a private, non-profit vocational college in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In addition to associate 2-year college programs Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.), Dunwoody also offers a Bachelor of Science in Applied Management for students with an associate degree.
Dunwoody offers programs and courses in Drafting and Estimating, Interior Design, Computer Networking, Programming, Electrical, Automotive Mechanics, Heating / Air Conditioning Systems Design, Food Science Technology, Electronics, Automated Systems and Robotics, Machine Tooling, Industrial Controls, Land Surveying, Construction Management, Graphic Design, Appliance Service and Printing, and Welding.
Dunwoody Institute was founded in 1914, when Minneapolis businessman William Hood Dunwoody left three million dollars in his will to ""provide for all time a place where youth without distinction on account of race, color or religious prejudice, may learn the useful trades and crafts, and thereby fit themselves for the better performance of life's duties."" When his widow, Kate L. Dunwoody, died a year later she left additional funds to keep the college moving forward.
In the spring of 1916, the Dunwoody Trustees purchased six city blocks, 3 long and 2 deep, facing the parade grounds. The Minneapolis City Council closed the streets and alleys that traversed the area creating a site of approximately 16 acres (6.5 ha). Hewitt and Brown Architects and Engineers were contracted to design a school building. Their draft included nine buildings which were composed of six shop buildings and a three-story administration facility with an auditorium on one side and a gymnasium building on the other.
Three years from the school’s inception, the first two buildings were opened in August 1917 and have remained throughout the century. In issues of the Artisan from this period, the Minneapolis Public Library had one of its branches on the campus offering its services the campus’s students. Located across from St. Mary’s Basilica and Loring Park, just west of downtown, the new facility was dedicated on October 31, 1917 and the space at the Minneapolis Central High School facility was left empty. Dr. Marion L. Burton, president of the University of Minnesota, gave the address. Dr. Prosser’s commencement address in May 1918 contrasted the new facility with the old one used in cooperation with the Minneapolis school district, “Roughly four years ago we were quartered in an old, tumble-down building that, with the kindness of the board of education, served us well in time of need.” 
When the University of Minnesota perceived its need for preparing instructors to teach in this new emerging area of vocational education, they began to look for partnerships. On April 22, 1920, Fred Snyder, President of the University of Minnesota, entered into a cooperative agreement with William Hood Dunwoody Institute allowing students who were enrolled at the University in teacher training courses to spend a portion of their class time at the institute to receive experiences related to observations and practice of all types of trade and industrial education. The reciprocity of this agreement allowed Dunwoody instructors to enroll and receive credit for any courses offered by the College of Education at the University that were a part of the teacher training authorized by the Smith Hughes Act. These matriculations were considered scholarships and did not encumber the University or the Institute in monetary exchanges, only the awarding of credits. There were no other recognizable post-secondary technical institutes or colleges at this time in the state of Minnesota.
In 1953, the era of the international perspective of Dunwoody Industrial Institute became manifest when Dunwoody was provided a grant by the Ford Foundation for the purpose of sending representatives to consult with the Indonesian Ministry of Education. Under the leadership of Dunwoody Industrial Institute’s second Director J. R. Kingman, an Indonesian Technical Teacher Training Institute was to be established in Ban dung, Java. An American, Dr. Milton G Towner was the advisor and director for the center. He was on leave as director of the Staff College of the Federal Civil Defense Administration in Washington, DC. Six American teachers from Dunwoody were sent with Dr. Towner to work with indigenous Indonesians in making training available to prospective and interested teachers in the Indonesian technical school system. Seven Indonesian teachers were sent to Dunwoody for training so they could return and support the efforts being directed by Dr. Towner. On November 27, 1953, Dr. K. Nagaraja Rao, a graduate of the University of Mysore, India, became the head of Dunwoody Industrial Institute’s new International Services Division. He was a native of India who taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the Korean Technical Institute, where he opened a department of chemical engineering. His job was to be the liaison between the Indonesia project and the Ford Foundation. Since 1951, he had been a consultant to the Government of Indonesia for the development of indigenous industries.
Mr. Phillip S. Van Wyck became the senior advisor of the Government Technical Institute in Insein, Burma. The development and operation of this government Technical Institute was funded by the Ford Foundation and assisted with staffing from Dunwoody. In 1956, Dunwoody Industrial Institute began its third technical assistance program in the Union of Burma, establishing the first technical high school in Rangoon. In a government-sponsored building, four Dunwoody employees assisted the local Burmese in developing shops, curriculum and demonstration materials. Burmese instructors were delivered the curriculum. The Annual Report of the Ford Foundation noted Dunwoody Institute’s efforts at Insein and Rangoon. It also it noted that a second Teacher’s Institute was started in Djakarta.
The Central Training Institute in Bombay India was opened in March 1963 with the assistance of a five-member team from Dunwoody, the Indian Government and the US Department of Education. In the Dunwoody News March 29, 1963 issue, a facsimile of the formal invitation indicating that Prime Minister Nehru of India would be addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Institute is found. That year another project began in Khartoum, Sudan, to establish the Khartoum Senior Trade school which opened in December 1964. Dr. Rao left Dunwoody Industrial Institute in 1965 to become a program officer for the Ford Foundation in the foundation’s Latin American program after a twelve-year tenure at the institute. Robert R. Minarik, a graduate of the Dunwoody electronics program and the University of Minnesota, replaced Rao, bringing his experience overseas from Burma and Saudi Arabia.
In 1967 Dunwoody began overseas programs with funding from private industries rather than foundations or United States Government sponsorship. The first initiative was with the Alumina Partners of Jamaica known as ALPART. Contracting directly with Dunwoody Institute, they desired the institute to organize and implement a training school for construction and maintenance workers. This ALPART Training Center for Industrial Skills was to serve the ALPART aluminum plant in Nain in South Central Jamaica. A senior team of Dunwoody employees would begin to train and set in place Jamaican personnel as trainers. Time-release training aimed at select job targets were dovetailed with on- the-job training and specific customized training manuals. This partnership came to a successful conclusion in the fall of 1972. During this time, a nine-member Dunwoody team worked with Esso Standard Libya Inc at the Marsa el Brega terminal in Libya. This refinery and production complex provided an opportunity for developing curriculum for and also operating ESSO’s Industrial Training Center. Further east in Saudi Arabia, the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) began a long-term training relationship that lasted into the 80’s. New hardware and software for basic and mid-level electric and electronic training at the Ras Tanura Industrial Training shops were targeted. The curriculum developed here was transferable to two other sites: one in Dhahran and the other in Abqaiq. Freeport Indonesia Inc hired a Dunwoody team to help in their copper mining project in Irian Jaya. The objective here was to assist in the training of the indigenous Indonesian work force as electrical, mechanical, and mobile machinery operators at the town site of Tembaga Pura. These mining facilities were remote, the Indonesians were from jungle tribes, and the size of the enterprise larger than Dunwoody Institute had ever attempted before.
In 2000, Dr. Jane Plihal, associate professor and chair of the Department of Work, Community and Family Education at the College of Education and Human Development reevaluated the 1920 “Cooperative Agreement Between Dunwoody Industrial Institute and the University of Minnesota.” She proposed a termination of the agreement. Plihal perceived the University’s perception of the agreement as anachronistic and no longer expressive of the ways in which the two institutions had been cooperating or could cooperate at the end of the century. A notice of termination for this agreement, signed on December 28, 2000 by Robert H Bruininks, Executive Vice President and Provost, voided the reciprocity agreement between the two institutions at the end of summer session 2001.
In 2003, Dunwoody Institute merged with NEI College of Technology of Columbia Heights, Minnesota, which specialized in electronics and computer technology. NEI's operations were moved to the Dunwoody campus and the old campus was sold and demolished. The combined institution was renamed Dunwoody College of Technology.

Founded on March 30, 1910, the university is a dual campus institution, with the main campus located in Hattiesburg and the Gulf Park campus located in Long Beach, with five additional teaching and research sites.
The university has a particularly extensive study-abroad program through its Center for International Education, and is consistently ranked as one of the top universities in the nation for the number of students studying abroad each year. It is especially noted for its British Studies program, which regularly sends more than 200 students each summer to live and study in the heart of London. The university is also home to a major polymer science research center, and one of the strongest fine arts programs in the southeastern United States.
Originally called the Mississippi Southerners, the Southern Miss athletic teams became the Golden Eagles in 1972.

The main campus is located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, with a second campus located in the Tradition community near Gulfport, Mississippi and Biloxi, Mississippi.
In the 2017 edition of U.S. News &amp; World Report’s America’s Best Colleges, William Carey University was ranked No. 2 Best Value among regional universities in the South for the second consecutive year. In 2015, William Carey University was ranked No. 1 Best Value among regional universities in the South.
William Carey University was founded by W. I. Thames in 1892 as Pearl River Boarding School in Poplarville, Mississippi. A disastrous fire destroyed the school in 1905, and in 1906, with the backing of a group of New Orleans businessmen, Thames re-opened the school in Hattiesburg as South Mississippi College. Another fire destroyed the young institution, forcing it to close. In 1911, W. S. F. Tatum acquired the property and offered it as a gift to the Baptists, and the school re-opened as Mississippi Woman's College. In 1953, the Mississippi Baptist Convention voted to move the college into coeducational status, which necessitated a new name for the institution. In 1954, the board of trustees selected the name of William Carey College in honor of William Carey, the eighteenth century English cobbler-linguist whose decades of missionary activity in India earned him international recognition as the “Father of Modern Missions.” The school changed to university status in 2006.
The university offers baccalaureate degrees in the areas of arts and letters, education, natural and behavioral sciences, business, religion, music, and nursing. The university also offers M.B.A, M.Ed., M.S. in psychology, M.S. in Health Information Systems, and an M.S.N. degree, as well as a specialist degree in elementary education and a Ph.D. in education administration. In 2009, William Carey opened the College of Osteopathic Medicine, and 2010, welcomed its first class of 110 students. In 2012, Carey added a Ph.D. program in nursing.

It changed names several times: to LaGrange Collegiate Seminary for Young Ladies in 1850, Southern and Western Female College in 1852, Southern Female College in 1854; and finally to Cox College by the 1890s. Part of the school moved to East Point, Georgia in the 1890s, however the main institution moved to Manchester, Georgia in 1895, which renamed itself College Park in 1896. By 1913 it was sometimes referred to as Cox College and Conservatory. It closed several times, including ten years between 1923–1933. It reopened one more time in 1933, but closed for a final time in 1934, leaving the city of College Park without a college.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,MO,2,4,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,2,Cfa,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,2,3,1,0,1,0.3889,490.531666666667,587.148333333333,475.488333333333,564.995,541.78,523.265,18.5866666666667,23.0583333333333,17.6166666666667,23.2166666666667,16.9966666666667,22.8016666666667,20.9566666666667,20.5766666666667,20.1216666666667,1071.89833333333,727,12600,12600,16752,10555,7134,0.6627,0.42613935183329,0.1334,50561,46442.6243666478,44049,28013,63452,29406,71994,26139,60706,3,335,1700,8999.88333333333,3526.74333333333,9762,3250,0.162829081631624,0.8638,0.011,0.0193,0.022,0.001,0.0014,0.0358,0.001,0.0468,0.386363636,0.193181818,0.206818182,0.115909091,0.097727273,11,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,37.225116,-93.290233,0.649700839,-1.628221726,2.56716666666666,1,C,27312,26826.6266666667,27312,5821.87166666667,6595.24333333333,4036.04,2250,702.056666666667,7108.79734504472,3.10609488317144,-0.125909269538455,23651.855312409,5,0.216049126383998

During the late nineteenth century, the institution moved to Fulton and expanded its elementary and secondary programs to accommodate young women who aspired to become teachers. Known briefly at the beginning of the twentieth century as Daughters College, the institution changed its name to William Woods College to honor a major benefactor and began offering a two-year college program. In 1962, anticipating dramatic changes in the role of American women in the labor force, William Woods became a four-year college.
Expanding its mission to address the need for graduate and adult-oriented programs, the institution became known as William Woods University in 1993 and began offering graduate degrees and admitting men as well as women into all of its programs.
The university was founded 1870 and although independent, has a historical affiliation to the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association and is ranked 91st in the Midwest among regional universities, according to the 2011 edition of Best Colleges by U.S. News Media Group.

181604,College of Saint Mary,Omaha,68106,"https://www.csm.edu/",181604.jpg,"College of Saint Mary is a Catholic women's university located in Omaha, Nebraska. Enrollment totaled 1,018 students in fall of 2014: 735 undergraduates, 243 graduate, and 40 non-degree seeking students.
With more than 30 undergraduate and seven graduate degree programs, College of Saint Mary offers associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees in high-demand majors such as occupational therapy, physician assistant studies, nursing, biology, business, education and legal studies. The student-to-faculty ratio is 10:1.
In 2004 CSM launched the largest campaign in its history, the $25 million Campaign for CSM. This effort was designed to provide critical resources in three key areas: Endowment building, growth of the annual scholarship fund and campus/facility improvements. The goal of $25 million was surpassed by the fall of 2009, yielding the transformation of the Campus Park (2006), the addition of Hixson-Lied Commons (2007), as well as the modernization of Walsh Hall (2007) and the renovation of CSM's Math and Science Building (2008). Hixson-Lied Commons is the location of CSM's Library as well as Christina's Place, a cafe offering coffee, breakfast and lunch options.
Since 2009, CSM's enrollment has been over 1,000 students and the residence halls have experienced record numbers in both 2010 and again in 2011 with 223 students living on-campus. The burgeoning residence halls and the need for additional OT laboratory space led to a $10 million campaign to build a new residence hall. CSM broke ground on the new residence hall in 2010, and Madonna Hall opened in 2012 to serve the Mothers Living &amp; Learning program.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,NE,2,4,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,30,0,1,2,Dfa,0,0,1,0,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1,0.4927,514.075,622.413333333333,510.14,612.661666666667,569.396666666667,560.325,20.0816666666667,25.7483333333333,19.5416666666667,25.815,18.4083333333333,25.35,23.2616666666667,23.15,22.015,1140.72166666667,800,20750,20750,12718,7995,6722,0.465,0.280996710218992,0,53828.8773798929,50564.2444146679,47387,35956.6508997806,64348,31760,67147,33850,64618,2,162,848,7850,2934,10548,3654,0.579546448241052,0.6963,0.0775,0.0938,0.0313,0.0063,0.0025,0.0788,0.005,0.0088,0.425055928,0.111856823,0.140939597,0.127516779,0.194630873,10,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1075,0,0,0.0215,0,0.0269,0,0.0323,0,0.0538,0,0,0,0.0161,0,0,0.0108,0,0.0591,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6452,0.0269,0,1,41.240028,-96.021425,0.719774272,-1.675890019,2.6,1,D,35800,32382,35800,19237,21845,17975,12822,10214,27128.0533044719,4.47853237441861,-0.356867278578088,12778.8645607772,5,0.275804253968918

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, Dartmouth is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Founded as a school to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, Dartmouth soon turned primarily to training Congregationalist ministers throughout its early history before it gradually secularized, emerging at the turn of the 20th century from relative obscurity into national prominence.
Following a liberal arts curriculum, the university provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 57 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized majors and minors or engage in dual degree programs. Dartmouth comprises five constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the School of Graduate and Advanced Studies. With a student enrollment of about 6,400, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions is highly competitive, with an acceptance rate of 10.5% for the Class of 2020, according to the university.
Dartmouth's 269-acre campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England. The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, strong Greek culture, and wide array of enduring campus traditions. Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I.
Dartmouth is consistently included among the highest-ranked universities in the United States by several institutional rankings. According to a Forbes study, despite its relatively small size, Dartmouth is ranked 8th among American universities that have produced billionaires. In a New York Times corporate study, Dartmouth's graduates were shown to be among the most sought-after and valued in the world.
Dartmouth has produced many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, 22 U.S. Governors, 10 billionaire graduates, 8 U.S. Cabinet officials, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. Vice President.

183080,Plymouth State University,Plymouth,03264-1595,"https://www.plymouth.edu/",default.png,"Plymouth State University (PSU), formerly Plymouth State College, is a coeducational, residential university located in Plymouth, New Hampshire, United States, with an enrollment of approximately 4,200 undergraduate students and 2,100 graduate students. The school was founded as Plymouth Normal School in 1871. Since that time it has evolved to a teachers college, a state college, and finally to a state university in 2003. PSU is part of the University System of New Hampshire.
It was founded as a teachers' college, and it still retains a teaching program/major to this day. Since that time, however, it has diversified its academic profile, adding many new majors and fields of study. The school has become known in recent years for its meteorology program (Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute), and is also strong in business, visual and performing arts, interdisciplinary studies, and psychology. Also, new majors such as criminal justice and nursing have been added and other programs have increased their stature, especially the natural sciences with the creation of The Center for the Environment.
Plymouth State is one of 311 institutions of higher learning nationwide included on the Carnegie Foundation Community Engagement Classification. According to Carnegie, PSU was honored for ""excellent alignment of mission, culture, leadership, resources, and practices that support dynamic and noteworthy community engagement."" Community service has long been a mainstay of the Plymouth State experience. The university’s motto, Ut prosim (That I may serve), underscores the values upon which the Plymouth State University mission is built. During the 2009–10 academic year, PSU students contributed approximately 220,000 hours to service.
The campus has grown substantially in recent years with the addition of the PSU Ice Arena and Welcome Center, the Museum of the White Mountains, Enterprise Center at Plymouth, and ALLWell North, a 107,600 square foot academic and athletics facility that includes a 200-meter indoor track. Langdon Woods, PSU's most recent residence hall, was one of the first collegiate residence halls in the U.S. to gain “Gold” certification by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high performance green buildings. Robert Frost, America's Poet Laureate, lived and taught at Plymouth from 1911 to 1912.

183239,Saint Anselm College,Manchester,03102-1310,"https://www.anselm.edu/",183239.jpg,"Saint Anselm College is a nationally ranked, Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college in Goffstown, New Hampshire, United States. Founded in 1889 by Abbot Hilary Pfrängle, O.S.B. of Saint Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey, at the request of Bishop Denis Mary Bradley of Manchester, New Hampshire, it is the third-oldest Catholic college in New England. Named for Saint Anselm of Canterbury (Archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1109), the college continues to have a fully functioning and independent Benedictine abbey attached to it, Saint Anselm Abbey. As of 2015, its enrollment is approximately 2,000.

According to the college, the student body is selected not only for their academic abilities but also for their personal character. The college's academic curriculum requires several philosophy and theology courses, as well as the new ""Conversatio"" program. The administration's commitment to an anti-grade inflation policy helped the college receive national media attention from the Fox News Channel in 2006, as well as a Tier 1 ranking from U.S. News and World Report, which in 2016 ranked the college 112th among national liberal arts colleges, with an admissions rate that is deemed ""selective"" at 73.7%. U.S. News &amp; World Report also ranked the college as the most popular New Hampshire venue for presidential candidates.Forbes magazine has ranked St. Anselm as the 85th best college in the nation, as well as the 40th in the Northeast. In 2015, Saint Anselm was recognized by Time magazine as one of the ""50 Best Liberal Arts Colleges"" in the nation.
Since the 1950s, the college has played an important role in the ""first in the nation"" New Hampshire primary, and has served as the national stage for many future presidents, candidates, and supporters. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon each delivered important policy speeches there. The college has been home to several national presidential debates which have attracted extensive media attention. The Washington Post recently referred to Saint Anselm College as ""the Benedictine college with a box seat on America's most riveting political theater"".
In 2013, Dr. Steven DiSalvo, the former president of Marian University was named the 10th president of Saint Anselm. DiSalvo replaced Father Jonathan DeFelice, O.S.B. after 24 years of service to the college. Father DeFelice was the longest serving college president in the state of New Hampshire. In 2015, Dr. DiSalvo announced that the Saint Anselm had applied to enter the exploratory phase of NCAA Division III membership for all athletic programs.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,NH,2,1,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,5,Dfb,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,0,0.7516,580,650,560,650,615,605,23,29,23,30,22,26,26,27,24,1224,2030,41800,41800,19195,13490,8943,0.7294,0.0345655514985248,0.3892,60648,57170.6387800398,53773,38115.9063013236,66399,40941,77999,36151,74446,10,628,1000,14750,4000,10200,3300,0.781954914887554,0.8626,0.0158,0.0453,0.0118,5e-04,5e-04,0.0197,0.0049,0.0389,0.086801427,0.067776457,0.105826397,0.133174792,0.606420928,11,50,0,0,0,0,0.0535,0,0.0209,0,0.0349,0.014,0,0.0047,0,0,0.0372,0.0047,0,0.0558,0.0186,0,0.0349,0,0.0047,0.0023,0.0279,0,0.0721,0,0.0093,0.1837,0,0,0,0,0.0093,0.193,0.1767,0.0419,1,42.986889,-71.503622,0.750262748,-1.247973631,2.8,2,D,56300,61550,56300,41248,36651,33832,29002,22182,41389.0011110032,2.45176618572254,0.280068857901815,7520.1342715204,5,0.342956367095117

It is commonly known as BMG, or Lakewood Yeshiva.
As of 2012, the yeshiva has 6,500 married and undergraduate students, making it the largest yeshiva in the United States and one of the largest yeshivas in the world. Over the years, the roshei yeshiva of BMG have all been associated with the Kotler family, beginning with Rabbi Aharon Kotler from 1943 until his death in 1962; Rabbi Shneur Kotler, his son, who led the yeshiva from 1962 until his death in 1982; and the present roshei yeshiva, Rabbi Malkiel Kotler (son of Shneur Kotler), Rabbi Dovid Schustal (son-in-law of Shneur Kotler), Rabbi Yerucham Olshin and Rabbi Yisroel Neuman (sons-in-law of Rabbi Dov Schwartzman).

184348,Drew University,Madison,7940,"https://www.drew.edu/",default.png,"Drew University is a coeducational private university located in Madison, New Jersey, in the United States. Drew has been nicknamed the ""University in the Forest"" because of the serenity of its wooded 186-acre campus (753,000 m2) when compared to the busy suburban area surrounding the school. As of 2015, 2,113 students are pursuing degrees at the university's three schools. Undergraduate tuition for the 2015–2016 academic year was US$59,661 (excluding books, personal expenditures, and health insurance), making Drew among the most expensive universities in New Jersey.
In 1867, financier and railroad tycoon Daniel Drew purchased an estate in Madison to establish a theological seminary to train candidates for ministry in the Methodist church. The seminary later expanded to offer an undergraduate liberal arts curriculum in 1928 and graduate studies in 1955. The College of Liberal Arts, serving 1,417 undergraduate students, offers strong concentrations in the natural sciences, social sciences, languages and literatures, humanities and the arts and in several interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields. The Drew Theological School, the third-oldest of thirteen Methodist seminaries affiliated with the United Methodist Church, currently enrolls 436 students preparing for careers in the ministry and the academic study of theology. The Caspersen School of Graduate Studies, enrolling 351 graduate students, offers masters and doctoral degrees in a variety of specialized and interdisciplinary fields.
While affiliated with the Methodist faith, Drew University makes no religious demands of its students. While many of the Theological School's students and faculty are United Methodist, students of all faiths are admitted to study.

Kean University serves its students in the liberal arts, the sciences, and the professions and is best known for its programs in the humanities and social sciences and in education, graduating the most teachers in the state of New Jersey annually. Kean is also noted for the physical therapy program which it holds in conjunction with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
Kean University was founded in 1855 in Newark, New Jersey, as the Newark Normal School. Initially established for the exclusive purpose of being a teacher-education college it became New Jersey State Teachers College in 1937. In 1958, following a post-war boom of students and increasing demands for a more comprehensive curriculum, the college was relocated from Newark to Union Township, site of the Kean family's ancestral home at Liberty Hall. After its move to the historic Livingston-Kean Estate, which includes the entire Liberty Hall acreage, the historic James Townley House, and Kean Hall, which historically housed the library of United States Senator Hamilton Fish Kean and served as a political meeting place, the school became Newark State College, a comprehensive institution providing a full range of academic programs and majors. Renamed Kean College of New Jersey in 1973, the institution earned university status on September 26, 1997, becoming Kean University of New Jersey. Kean University has subsequently grown to become the third largest institution of higher education in New Jersey and currently comprises five undergraduate colleges and the Nathan Weiss Graduate College. Kean University also hosts numerous research institutions, perhaps most prominently the New Jersey Center for Science, Technology and Mathematics, the Kean University Human Rights Institute, the Holocaust Recourse Center, the Wynona Moore Lipman Ethnic Studies Center, and Liberty Hall.

New York City, 9 miles (14.5 km) and under 30 minutes away, is directly accessible from campus via public transit.
Founded in 1881 with the support of local industrialists and inventors, especially Edward Weston (334 US Patents), NJIT opened as Newark Technical School in 1884. Application oriented from inception the school grew into a classic engineering college – Newark College of Engineering (NCE) – and then, with the addition of a School of Architecture in 1973, into a polytechnic university that is now home to five colleges and one school.
NJIT opened with 88 students. As of fall 2016, the university enrolls over 11,300 students, 2,200 of whom live on campus. Architecturally significant buildings include Eberhardt Hall, the Campus Center, and the Central King Building – in the Collegiate Gothic style – which is being renovated into a STEM center. Facilities under construction include a Wellness and Events Center that will house a 3,500-seat venue for social and sporting events.
NJIT offers 50 undergraduate (Bachelor of Science/Arts) majors and 78 graduate (Masters and PhD) programs. Via its Honors College it also offers professional programs in collaboration with several nearby institutions including a program in medicine (BS, MD) with Rutgers Medical School, and an engineering + law program (BS, JD) with Seton Hall Law School.
The university is organized into 21 departments; three of which, Biological Sciences, History, and Theater Arts, are federated with Rutgers-Newark whose campus borders NJIT's. With a student population that is almost 20% international, NJIT ranks among the most ethnically diverse national universities in the country. It has multiple study abroad options along with extensive co-op, internship, and service opportunities. According to PayScale (2016–17) NJIT ranks 20th among Engineering Schools and 33rd among Research Universities in the US by Salary Potential.
NJIT's R&amp;D expenditures were $110 million in 2015 and $131 million in 2016. Areas of focus include: applied mathematics, materials science, biomedical engineering, signal processing, and solar-terrestrial physics – of which the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research is a world leader. A key agent in regional economic development, NJIT hosts the Enterprise Development Center (EDC), an on-campus business incubator that houses over 90 start-ups, and the New Jersey Innovation Institute (NJII) which offers R&amp;D services to business.
NJIT is a member of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, a Sea Grant College, and a member of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture.

The college is recognized as one of the best public institutions in the United States, and is consistently ranked as the #1 public institution in New Jersey in its category; known for its programs in business, education, engineering, humanities, nursing and science. TCNJ aims to combine the best practices of private institutions with a public mission, resulting in an innovative and unique model for undergraduate education. The college encourages free inquiry and open exchange, offering a wide range of learning opportunities in its classrooms, laboratories, and studios, and throughout the campus, as well as at various off-campus locations.
The institution is organized into seven schools, all of which offer four-year bachelor's degree programs, and several of which offer targeted master's degree programs.

189097,Barnard College,New York,10027-6598,"https://www.barnard.edu/",189097.jpg,"Barnard College is a private women's liberal arts college in New York City. Founded in 1889 as a response to Columbia University's refusal to admit women into their institution, it is one of the oldest women's colleges in the world, and the only women's college in New York City today. It has been affiliated with Columbia University since 1900.
The school was founded by Annie Nathan Meyer and named after Frederick Barnard, tenth president of Columbia. When Columbia became coeducational in 1983 Barnard elected to remain legally and financially separate but maintained its affiliated relationship with the university. This includes shared academic programs and other academic privileges, and a combined athletic program. Barnard students also receive Columbia University degrees and graduate at Columbia University graduation. Barnard confers the Bachelor of Arts degree in about 50 areas of study. Students may also pursue elements of their education at the Juilliard School and The Jewish Theological Seminary.
Barnard's 4-acre (1.6 ha) campus is located in the Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights, stretching along Broadway between 116th and 120th Streets.

190415,Cornell University,Ithaca,14853,"https://www.cornell.edu/",190415.png,"Cornell University (/kɔːrˈnɛl/ kor-NEL) is an American private Ivy League and federal land-grant doctoral university located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge—from the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: ""I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.""
The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar.
Cornell is one of three private land grant universities in the nation and the only one in New York. Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and human ecology colleges. Of Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. As a land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens (more than 4,300 acres) are considered, as well as the numerous university-owned lands in New York City.
Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. Cornell counts more than 245,000 living alumni, and its former and present faculty and alumni include 34 Marshall Scholars, 29 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Truman Scholars, 7 Gates Scholars, 46 Nobel laureates, and 14 living billionaires. The student body consists of more than 14,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and more than 120 countries.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,NY,2,2,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfb,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1,0.1085,680,760,720,800,720,760,32,35,33,36,30,35,34,35,33,1487,14976,57222,57222,28874,29893,15574,0.9074,0.0440712209746279,0.4614,91176,84039,78779,55686,131398,59566,147189,48440,115804,229,3310,970,15246,2820,15246,2820,0.945301790461905,0.3578,0.0667,0.1388,0.1989,0.003,0.001,0.0495,0.1037,0.0805,0.241802023,0.117683114,0.128409439,0.147716825,0.364388599,9,80,0.1156,0.0184,0.0295,0.01,0.0192,0,0.1222,0,0,0.1531,0,0.0092,0.0274,0,0.0105,0.0026,0,0.138,0.0163,0,0.0097,0,0.0053,0,0.0242,0,0.0145,0,0.0163,0.0798,0,0,0,0,0.0105,0.0058,0.1509,0.0105,2,42.4472,-76.483084,0.740843398,-1.334881638,3.6,1,D,76258,76258,76258,66395,66361,62010,50751,18062,69651.1634572316,5.85404915886918,1.78727860251792,2763.7490159538,1,3.34948496505495

190983,Elmira College,Elmira,14901,"https://www.elmira.edu/",190983.jpg,"Elmira College is a coeducational private liberal arts college located in Elmira, in the U.S. state of New York's Southern Tier region.
The college is noted as among the oldest colleges still in existence which (as a college for women) granted degrees to women that were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the Wesleyan College located in Macon, GA, in 1840). Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.
The college, founded in 1855, has an enrollment of about 1200 students. The school's colors, purple and gold, are seen throughout the traditional campus, consisting mainly of ivy-covered buildings of the Victorian and Collegiate Gothic architectural styles. The colors purple and gold come from both the banners of the women's suffrage movement and the iris, the college flower.
Offered are about thirty-five major areas of study, each ultimately leading to either a B.S. or B.A. degree upon a successful completion of undergraduate studies. Students attend two full terms in the fall and winter and then enroll in a 6-week, intensive ""Term III"" in the spring. This gives students a unique opportunity to study abroad, intern, or take classes not related to their majors so as to enrich the educational experience.

From its founding in 1919 by progressive New York educators, and for most of its history, the university was known as The New School for Social Research. Between 1997 and 2005 it was known as New School University. The university and each of its colleges were renamed in 2005.
The New School established the University in Exile in 1933 as a graduate division to serve as an academic haven for scholars escaping from Nazi Germany among other adversarial regimes in Europe. In 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005, it adopted what had initially been the name of the whole institution, the New School for Social Research, while the larger institution was renamed The New School.
The New School has launched or housed a range of institutions such as the international research institute World Policy Institute, the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, the India China Institute, the Observatory on Latin America, and the Center for New York City Affairs. Parsons School of Design is the New School's art school.

It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.
The institution was founded in 1957 in Oyster Bay as State University College on Long Island, and would evolve into the present university after a move to Stony Brook in 1962. Since its establishment in Stony Brook, the university has expanded to include more than 200 major buildings with a combined area of more than 11 million gross square feet across 1,454 acres of land. In 2001, SUNY Stony Brook was elected to the Association of American Universities, joining four private universities (Cornell, Columbia, NYU, and Rochester) and one public university (SUNY Buffalo) elsewhere in its state. It is also a member of the larger Universities Research Association for which its president Samuel Stanley is a council president.
The university owns Stony Brook Medicine, co-manages the Brookhaven National Laboratory, in 2005 acquired land for a Research &amp; Development Park adjacent to its main campus, and has four business incubators across the region. The university has a regional economic impact of over $4.6 billion annually accounting for nearly 4% of economic activity in eastern Long Island and research expenditures that have surpassed the $200 million mark annually.
Stony Brook is the largest single-site employer on Long Island. More than 24,500 students are enrolled at the university, which has over 14,500 employees and over 2,400 faculty.

The institution's roots can be traced to the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (later becoming Genesee College), founded in 1831 by the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York. After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as nonsectarian, although it maintains a relationship with The United Methodist Church.
The campus is in the University Hill neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of downtown, on one of the larger hills. Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century Romanesque Revival structures to contemporary buildings. SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges, with nationally recognized programs in information studies and library science, architecture, communications, business administration, inclusive education and wellness, sport management, public administration, engineering and the College of Arts and Sciences.
Syracuse University athletic teams, known as the Orange, participate in 20 intercollegiate sports. SU is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference for all NCAA Division I athletics, except for the men's rowing and women's ice hockey teams. SU is also a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,NY,2,2,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfb,1,1,1,0,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1,0.4438,580,670,600,710,625,655,26,30,25,33,25,30,28,29,28,1291,14854,53849,53849,27650,18538,12051,0.6685,0.0640676151774356,0.4663,71470,64639,58773,41513,89498,46379,101814,39115,77580,186,4000,1536,15910,1774,15910,1774,0.826979792003246,0.5604,0.065,0.0954,0.0646,0.0057,7e-04,0.0339,0.1459,0.0285,0.224983059,0.10842557,0.138242602,0.151118139,0.37723063,15,85,0,0,0.0386,0.0032,0.1444,0.0035,0.0772,0,0.0187,0.0787,0,0.0073,0.0345,0,0.0202,0.0041,0,0.0401,0.0096,0,0.0047,0.0404,0.0029,0,0.0108,0,0.0643,3e-04,0.0228,0.1392,0,0,0,0,0.0971,0.0237,0.1053,0.0085,1,43.040176,-76.136975,0.751192782,-1.328840896,3.1,1,D,73069,73069,73069,53226,49030,45692,42468,23492,46444.4178838096,5.01400341743173,1.00324734243717,6522.13397671297,3,1.49753725520443

Founded in 1861 by Matthew Vassar, it was the first degree-granting institution of higher education for women in the United States. It became coeducational in 1969, and now has a gender ratio at the national average. The school is one of the historic Seven Sisters, the first elite female colleges in the U.S., and has a historic relationship with Yale University, which suggested a merger with the college before coeducation at both institutions.
The college offers B.A. degrees in more than 50 majors and features a flexible curriculum designed to promote a breadth of studies. Vassar also offers many extracurricular organizations including student theater, a cappella groups, club sports, volunteer and service groups, and a circus troupe. Vassar College's varsity sports teams, known as the Brewers, play in the NCAA's Division III as members of the Liberty League.
Vassar tied for the 12th best liberal arts college in the nation in the 2017 annual ranking of U.S. News &amp; World Report, with admissions described as ""most selective."" For the freshman class entering fall 2016, the college had an acceptance rate of 26.9%. The total number of students attending the college is around 2,450.
The Vassar campus comprises over 1,000 acres (400 ha) and more than 100 buildings, including two National Historic Landmarks and an additional National Historic Place.

It is one of two historically black colleges that enroll women only. Today it serves roughly 780 undergraduate students.
In 1956 Willa Beatrice Player was installed as the first African-American woman president of an accredited, four-year liberal arts college. She encouraged her students as activists in issues of the day. Beginning in 1960, Bennett students took part in the ultimately successful campaign in Greensboro to integrate ""white"" lunch counters at local variety stores. Since the late 1960s, they continued with other efforts. The college expanded its academic offerings and classes related to women's leadership.

198419,Duke University,Durham,27708,"https://www.duke.edu/",198419.png,"Duke University is an American private research university located in Durham, North Carolina. Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established The Duke Endowment, at which time the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke.
Duke's campus spans over 8,600 acres (3,500 hectares) on three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in Beaufort. The main campus—designed largely by architect Julian Abele—incorporates Gothic architecture with the 210-foot (64-meter) Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation. The first-year-populated East Campus contains Georgian-style architecture, while the main Gothic-style West Campus 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) away is adjacent to the Medical Center. Duke is the seventh-wealthiest private university in America with $11.4 billion in cash and investments in fiscal year 2014.
Duke's research expenditures in the 2015 fiscal year were $1.037 billion, the seventh largest in the nation. In 2014, Thomson Reuters named 32 of Duke's professors to its list of Highly Cited Researchers, making it fourth globally in terms of primary affiliations. Duke also ranks fifth among national universities to have produced Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater, and Udall Scholars. Ten Nobel laureates and three Turing Award winners are affiliated with the university. Duke's sports teams compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference and the basketball team is renowned for having won five NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships, most recently in 2015.
Duke is consistently included among the best universities in the world by numerous university rankings, and among the most innovative, according to a Reuters' survey. According to a Forbes study, Duke is ranked 11th among universities that have produced billionaires. In a New York Times corporate study, Duke's graduates were shown to be among the most sought-after and valued in the world, and Forbes magazine ranked Duke seventh in the world on its list of 'power factories' in 2012.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,NC,2,5,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,71,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,0,1,1,0.076,720,770,760,800,745,780,33,35,34,36,32,35,34,35,34,1522,6546,58031,58031,29952,68756,16863,0.9364,0.0324597498774603,0.4954,93115,79843,77260,53443,126716,61558,151838,47579,112796,109,1759,1434,15588,1976,14797.3783333333,2506.18666666667,0.9462016755044,0.4129,0.0883,0.0969,0.2101,0.0063,3e-04,0.0466,0.0964,0.0423,0.288680509,0.115874079,0.142665774,0.123911587,0.328868051,6,85,0,0.0205,0,0.0118,5e-04,0,0.0926,0,0.0156,0.1598,0,0.0086,0,0,0.0205,0,0,0.1507,0.0323,0,0.0011,0,0.0086,0,0.0237,0,0.0657,0,0.0877,0.183,0,0,0,0,0.021,0.0786,0,0.0178,1,36.001135,-78.937624,0.62833834,-1.377721443,3.6,1,C,76768.565,77029,76768.565,82913,76419,70955,56730,26425,68837.8637096454,5.55293155663889,2.63813954829314,2665.86701180113,1,3.5052940037366

Chartered in 1951, the college is sponsored by the Original Free Will Baptist Convention. The college’s roots and educational philosophy can be traced as early as 1897 when Free Will Baptists in Pitt County, North Carolina, citing a growing need for education in the community, led a discourse on education within the church. These efforts ultimately resulted in the founding of the Ayden Theological Seminary and its successor institution, Eureka College, both in Ayden, North Carolina, to educate ministers and provide a liberal arts education to the local constituency. After a catastrophic fire destroyed the administration building in 1931, Eureka College ceased operations, and the Free Will Baptist church’s efforts to fulfill its educational vision were reinvested in the founding of Mount Olive College. In January 2014 the college changed its name to THE University of Mount Olive.

It is one of the 17 campuses of the University of North Carolina system. After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, which also allows it to be one of three schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States.
The first public institution of higher education in North Carolina, the school opened its doors to students on February 12, 1795. The university offers degrees in over 70 courses of study through fourteen colleges and the College of Arts and Sciences. All undergraduates receive a liberal arts education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university or within the College of Arts and Sciences from the time they obtain junior status. Under the leadership of President Kemp Plummer Battle, in 1877 North Carolina became coeducational and began the process of desegregation in 1951 when African-American graduate students were admitted under Chancellor Robert Burton House. In 1952, North Carolina opened its own hospital, UNC Health Care, for research and treatment, and has since specialized in cancer care. The school's students, alumni, and sports teams are known as ""Tar Heels"".
The campus covers 729 acres (3 km2) of Chapel Hill's downtown area, encompassing the Morehead Planetarium and the many stores and shops located on Franklin Street. Students can participate in over 550 officially recognized student organizations. The student-run newspaper The Daily Tar Heel has won national awards for collegiate media, while the student radio station WXYC provided the world's first internet radio broadcast. North Carolina is one of the charter members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which was founded on June 14, 1953. Competing athletically as the Tar Heels, North Carolina has achieved great success in sports, most notably in men's basketball, women's soccer, and women's field hockey.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,NC,1,5,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,0,1,1,0.2263,650,730,660,770,690,715,28,33,28,35,26,32,31,32,29,1402,19014,8980,36159,14501,27786,12783,0.7613,0.0626012552211212,0.4035,61915,57004,51002,38992,84794,42413,93466,33388,75822,288,5395,972,11526,2750,11526,2750,0.905615879795578,0.5876,0.0809,0.0858,0.1149,0.0044,5e-04,0.0493,0.0397,0.0369,0.259648371,0.155874786,0.162950257,0.147727273,0.273799314,13,85,0,0.0238,0,0.0313,0.1124,0,0.0684,0,0.0124,0.0165,0,0.0146,0.0054,0,0.0195,0.0051,0,0.1167,0.0326,0,0.0133,0.0611,0.0075,0,0.0337,0,0.0804,0,0.0255,0.1306,0,0,0,0,0.0165,0.0643,0.0899,0.0184,1,35.911769,-79.050969,0.626778609,-1.379699686,3.5,1,C,24228,51407,51407,19750,17713,12716,5422,1541,43847.5194161002,4.89199950482169,1.28683016277715,3087.45876135861,2,2.76084577833222

Academic programs are enhanced by an Honors Program and the John M. Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs.
The university consists of four Colleges—the College of Arts and Sciences, the Schar College of Education, the Dauch College of Business and Economics, and the Schar College of Nursing and Health Sciences—and a large Graduate School offering degree programs in Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing (MFA), Master of American History and Government (MAHG), Master of Arts in Health and Risk Communication, Master of Education (MEd), Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) programs. In addition, Ashland Theological Seminary, a division of Ashland University, offers a doctor of ministry degree as well as a number of master's degrees.
In addition to the main campus in Ashland, the University operates centers in a variety of locations throughout the state, including Cleveland, Columbus, Elyria, Massillon, Mansfield, Medina and Westlake.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,OH,2,3,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,0,1,1,Dfb,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1,0.7117,500,600,500,590,550,545,19,24,18,23,18,25,22,21,22,1104,2973,21980,21980,12408,6634,7288,0.3376,0.292663405970266,0.4164,48165,43337,40173,32685,57996,34812,64799,29216,53231,25,1008,912,10340,2596,5500,3728,0.648437670422649,0.7403,0.1026,0.0353,0.0091,0.004,0.0024,0.0249,0.0232,0.0582,0.605323694,0.081169898,0.097272429,0.104502136,0.111731844,16,0,0,0.0022,0,0.0011,0.0914,0,0.0043,0,0.1355,0,0,0,0,0,0.0075,0.2462,0,0.0387,0.0054,0,0.0043,0.0118,0.0054,0,0.0022,0,0.0129,0.0527,0.014,0.0151,0,0,0,0,0.0129,0.1763,0.1495,0.0108,1,40.861755,-82.321061,0.713172163,-1.436773558,2.8,3,D,32120,35828,32120,17621,16452,13678,11501,10104,25419.2488152567,4.10610384268849,-0.181330634276156,9058.40272648224,6,0.0734386748188632

The university was created in 1967 by the federation of Case Institute of Technology (founded in 1881 by Leonard Case Jr.) and Western Reserve University (founded in 1826 in the area that was once the Connecticut Western Reserve). Time magazine described the merger as the creation of ""Cleveland's Big-Leaguer"" university.
In U.S. News &amp; World Report's 2015 rankings, Case Western Reserve's undergraduate program ranked 37th among national universities. In 2016, the inaugural edition of The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education (WSJ/THE) ranked Case Western Reserve as 32nd among all universities and 29th among private institutions. The University is associated with 16 Nobel laureates. Other notable alumni include Paul Buchheit, creator and lead developer of Gmail, founder of FriendFeed, and Partner at Y Combinator; Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org; Pete Koomen, the co-founder and CTO of Optimizely; and Peter Tippett, who developed the anti-virus software Vaccine, which Symantec purchased and turned into the popular Norton AntiVirus. Case Western Reserve is particularly well known for its medical school, business school, dental school, law school, Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing (named for former U.S. Representative Frances P. Bolton), Department of Biomedical Engineering and its biomedical teaching and research capabilities. It is also a leading institution for research in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering. Currently (2017), the Editor for the Journal of the Electrochemical Society is a Case professor, and the university is home to six Fellows of the Electrochemical Society. Case Western Reserve is a member of the Association of American Universities.
The university is approximately five miles (8 km, 4.34488 nm) east of downtown Cleveland in the neighborhood known as University Circle, a 550-acre (220 ha) area containing numerous other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. Case Western Reserve has a number of programs taught in conjunction with University Circle institutions, including the Cleveland Clinic, the University Hospitals of Cleveland, the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veteran's Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland Institute of Music, the Cleveland Hearing &amp; Speech Center, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Institute of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and the Cleveland Play House.

The famous Michelson–Morley interferometer experiment was conducted in 1887 in the basement of a campus dormitory by Albert A. Michelson of Case School of Applied Science and Edward W. Morley of Western Reserve University. This experiment proved the non-existence of the luminiferous ether and was later understood as convincing evidence in support of special relativity as proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. Michelson became the first American to win a Nobel Prize in science. The commemorative Michelson-Morley Memorial Fountain as well as an Ohio Historical Marker are located on campus, near where the actual experiment was performed.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,OH,2,3,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,1,1,0.2736,640,720,700,790,680,745,30,34,31,35,29,34,32,33,32,1436,5269,50924,50924,27364,31082,12116,0.7662,0.0554585635020149,0.5426,78330,69719,65156,44544,95699,52462,106011,38880,87443,59,1061,1200,15614,1900,15614,1900,0.84391896608081,0.447,0.0455,0.0886,0.2148,0.0023,6e-04,0.0531,0.1368,0.0112,0.150960659,0.104300092,0.129002745,0.182067704,0.433668802,11,70,0,0,9e-04,9e-04,0,0,0.0977,0,9e-04,0.3207,0,0.0035,0.0138,0,0.0138,0.0017,0,0.1098,0.0467,0,0.0467,0,0.0061,0,0.0588,0,0.0372,0,0,0.0536,0,0,0,0,0.0216,0.0527,0.1054,0.0078,1,41.507419,-81.609596,0.724441126,-1.424356151,3.5,1,D,69638,69638,69638,48569,48243,45041,37670,25382,52089.779988708,5.28218490932958,1.17586740900968,6522.58240448167,2,2.77425124002335

The school changed its name to the University of Steubenville upon achieving university status in 1980, and adopted the current title Franciscan University of Steubenville in 1986.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,OH,2,3,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,1,Cfa,1,0,1,0,1,2,4,1,3,1,1,1,0.7664,570,670,520,630,620,575,22,29,22,31,19,26,26,27,23,1215,2138,28880,28880,14801,8114,8198,1,0.074450863329186,0.4097,43769,42836.3605739293,40389,26170.5153223583,58998,26523,65045,24475,52985,38,585,1200,8680,1870,5400,2060,0.774817795374906,0.7905,0.008,0.1291,0.0201,0.0023,9e-04,0.0206,0.0108,0.0178,0.125615764,0.092364532,0.169950739,0.219211823,0.392857143,14,0,0,0,0,0,0.0562,0,0.0238,0,0.0886,0,0,0.0065,0.0022,0,0.041,0.0475,0,0.041,0.0367,0,0.0151,0,0.0324,0.2009,0.0065,0,0.0691,0,0.041,0.0346,0,0,0,0,0.0086,0.108,0.1123,0.0281,1,40.376919,-80.620524,0.704710178,-1.407093588,3,1,C,37540,40630,37540,19726,18713,17715,15170,10493,29385.3255591931,3.18601226801162,0.246443824977376,5833.27154689347,4,0.576135835757688

Ursuline College is a small, Roman Catholic liberal arts women's-focused college in Pepper Pike, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1871 by the Ursuline Sisters of Cleveland and is one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women in the United States. From 1978 until about 2001 Ursuline admitted men but didn't allow them to live in the dorms. Ursuline College offers a diverse spectrum of undergraduate and graduate studies within the Catholic tradition of education. The college offers 30 undergraduate, 11 graduate programs, and a Doctorate of Nursing Practice. In 2015, Ursuline College had 706 undergraduate and 530 graduate students. Although Ursuline College focuses primarily on the liberal arts, it also offers courses such as nursing and business administration.
The campus is situated approximately 10 miles outside of Cleveland and 30 miles outside of Akron. Ursuline's campus is quite spacious and meticulously landscaped, featuring 12 educational buildings, including the most recently constructed Sister Diana Stano Athletic Center, the Parker Hannifin Center for the Creative Healing Arts &amp; Sciences, and the Bishop Anthony M. Pilla Center.
In July 2013, the O'Brien Athletic Center was destroyed by a tornado that ripped through the campus. With generous donations from the community and insurance payments, a new athletic center was completed for Fall 2015. The Sister Diana Stano Athletic Center offers a fitness space overlooking the campus, a gymnasium, shower and locker rooms for visiting and home athletic teams, offices, and conference rooms. The Parker Hannifin Center for the Healing Arts and Sciences, also completed for Fall 2015 semester, provides educational equipment and classrooms for Nursing and Art Therapy students.
The Pilla Center, the main gathering space has a view of the lake, and is two stories high with windows on adjacent sides, and a luminescent stained glass window that faces the main quadrangle. It has a new dining hall, staffed by Metz Culinary Management, that offers a food court.

In spring 2015, DelVal was given approval for a physician assistant program, which will be in place by 2018.
DelVal, as it is commonly called, had a for-credit employment program that required students to work 500 hours in an area of their major; however, this program is now evolving into a more comprehensive experiential learning program, called E360. The program is part of the college’s legacy of linking theoretical learning with practical training. Each department at the college is incorporating E360 into its curriculum.

All students of the College are undergraduates, and nearly all reside on campus.
The college was founded in 1833 by area members of the Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) to ensure an education grounded in Quaker values for young Quaker men. Although the college no longer has a formal religious affiliation, Quaker philosophy still influences campus life. Originally an all-male institution, Haverford began admitting female transfer students in the 1970s and became fully co-educational in 1980. Currently, more than half of Haverford's students are women. For most of the 20th century, Haverford's total enrollment was kept below 300, but the school went through two periods of expansion during and after the 1970s, and its current enrollment is 1,290 students.

215062,University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,19104-6303,"https://www.upenn.edu/",215062.png,"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private Ivy League research university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges.
Benjamin Franklin, Penn's founder, advocated an educational program that focused as much on practical education for commerce and public service as on the classics and theology, though his proposed curriculum was never adopted. The university coat of arms features a dolphin on the red chief, adopted directly from the Franklin family's own coat of arms. Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow a multidisciplinary model pioneered by several European universities, concentrating multiple ""faculties"" (e.g., theology, classics, medicine) into one institution. It was also home to many other educational innovations. The first school of medicine in North America (Perelman School of Medicine, 1765), the first collegiate business school (Wharton School of Business, 1881), and the first ""student union"" building and organization (Houston Hall, 1896) were founded at Penn. With an endowment of $10.72 billion (2016), Penn had the seventh largest endowment of all colleges in the United States. All of Penn's schools exhibit very high research activity. In fiscal year 2015, Penn's academic research budget was $851 million, involving more than 4,300 faculty, 1,100 postdoctoral fellows and 5,500 support staff/graduate assistants.
Over its history, the university has also produced many distinguished alumni. These include 14 heads of state (including two U.S. Presidents); 25 billionaires - the most of any university in the world at the undergraduate level; three United States Supreme Court justices; over 33 United States Senators, 42 United States Governors, and 158 members of the U.S. House of Representatives; 8 signers of the United States Declaration of Independence; and 12 signers of the United States Constitution. In addition, some 30 Nobel laureates, 169 Guggenheim Fellows, and 80 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, have been affiliated with Penn. In addition, Penn has produced a significant number of Fortune 500 CEOs, trailing only Harvard and Stanford worldwide.",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,PA,2,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,1,1,0.0766,700,760,750,800,730,775,33,35,34,36,32,35,34,35,34,1511,10774,57770,57770,42393,56874,18277,0.7779,0.0964368255769882,0.4602,103246,92773,80445,57474,146940,65218,174907,48111,125432,129,2454,1358,16190,1946,14406,1946,0.960000511993446,0.3998,0.0799,0.1004,0.2156,0.0011,5e-04,0.0508,0.1275,0.0244,0.398684751,0.152486642,0.136046034,0.092067407,0.220715167,6,75,0,0.0048,0.0041,0.0041,0.0266,0,0.0611,0,0,0.0976,0,0.0184,0,0,0.0174,0,0,0.0986,0.0256,0,0.0399,0,0.0614,0,0.0208,0,0.0256,0,0.0017,0.1447,0,0,0,0,0.0222,0.0966,0.2078,0.0212,1,39.950929,-75.19391,0.69727525,-1.312381307,3.6,1,C,75480,77264,75480,72122,70470,62551,54671,33882,73370.3638690149,5.68775009428382,2.61432132333676,2063.80430994104,1,3.47314153676531

Founded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers from three ""Hicksite"" yearly meetings: Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York. Many of the founders were prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements and other social concerns and included Edward Parrish, (1822–1872), Deborah and Joseph Wharton, Benjamin Hallowell, and James and Lucretia Mott, (1793–1880). Swarthmore was established to be a college, ""...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country."" By 1906, Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation, becoming officially non-sectarian.
Swarthmore is a member of the ""Tri-College Consortium"", a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford Colleges. In addition, the College is affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania through the ""Quaker Consortium,"" allowing for students to cross-register for classes at all four institutions.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,PA,2,2,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,0,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,1,0,0.0893,680,750,700,790,715,745,31,35,33,35,29,34,33,34,32,1469,1584,54656,54656,29770,37534,13598,0.8902,0.0317871229800066,0.4962,72637,58704,51200,32829.0397707521,87858,52209,116028,30903,93513,28,228,1400,16088,1788,14048.8966666667,1921.33,0.940702473037244,0.3744,0.077,0.1282,0.1572,0.0038,0.0013,0.0745,0.1433,0.0404,0.28057554,0.212230216,0.115107914,0.079136691,0.31294964,8,60,0,0.0219,0,0.0049,0,0,0.0681,0,0.0243,0.0754,0,0.0438,0,0,0.0414,0,0,0.1265,0.0827,0,0.0341,0,0.0341,0,0.0414,0,0.056,0,0,0.2749,0,0,0,0,0.0462,0,0,0.0243,1,39.905159,-75.354278,0.696476413,-1.315180257,3.5,2,C,72026.2266666667,73932,72026.2266666667,65307,62466,57423,45367,31521,42896.0327704983,5.77946767344888,1.53322813247264,1947.24935600562,2,3.18991447265884

216339,Temple University,Philadelphia,19122-6096,"https://www.temple.edu/",default.png,"Temple University (commonly referred to as Temple) is a state-related-public doctoral university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded in 1884 by Baptist Minister Russell Conwell. In 1882, Conwell came to Pennsylvania to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules. These students, later dubbed ""night owls,"" were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple, hence the origin of the university's name and mascot. By 1907, the institution revised its institutional status and incorporated as a university.

216667,Washington & Jefferson College,Washington,15301,"https://www.washjeff.edu/",216667.png,"Washington &amp; Jefferson College, also known as W &amp; J College or W&amp;J, is a private liberal arts college in Washington, Pennsylvania, in the United States, which is 30 mi (48 km) south of Pittsburgh. The college traces its origin to three log cabin colleges in Washington County established by three Presbyterian missionaries to the American frontier in the 1780s: John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, and Joseph Smith. These early schools eventually grew into two competing academies and colleges, with Canonsburg Academy, later Jefferson College, located in Canonsburg and Washington Academy, later Washington College, in Washington. These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington &amp; Jefferson College. The 60-acre (24 ha) campus, located in Washington, Pennsylvania, has more than 40 buildings, with the oldest dating to 1793. While the college has historically had a difficult relationship with the city of Washington, including clashes over college expansion and finances, recent efforts have been made to improve those relations.
The college's academic emphasis is on the liberal arts and the sciences, with a focus on preparing students for graduate and professional schools. Campus activities include various religious, political, and general interest clubs, as well as academic and professional-themed organizations. The college has a strong history of competing literary societies, dating back before the union of Jefferson and Washington Colleges. Students operate a college radio station, a campus newspaper, and a literary journal. The athletic program competes in NCAA Division III. The football team has been particularly successful over its history, even competing in the 1922 Rose Bowl. A large majority of students participate in intramural athletics. Nearly all students live on campus and roughly one third are members of fraternities or sororities. A number of noteworthy alumni have attended the college or its predecessor institutions, including James G.

217156,Brown University,Providence,2912,"https://www.brown.edu/",217156.jpg,"Brown University is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, founded in 1764 as ""The College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations."" Brown is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges established before the American Revolution.
At its foundation, Brown was the first college in the United States to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation. Its engineering program was established in 1847 and was the first in the Ivy League. It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding master and doctoral studies in 1887. Brown's New Curriculum is sometimes referred to in education theory as the Brown Curriculum and was adopted by faculty vote in 1969 after a period of student lobbying. The New Curriculum eliminated mandatory ""general education"" distribution requirements, made students ""the architects of their own syllabus,"" and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory or unrecorded no-credit. In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution Pembroke College was fully merged into the university. Pembroke Campus now operates as a place for dorms and classrooms.
Undergraduate admissions is very selective, with an acceptance rate of 9 percent for the class of 2020, according to the university.

Wofford was founded with a bequest of $100,000 from the Rev. Benjamin Wofford (1780–1850), a Methodist minister and Spartanburg native who sought to create a college for ""literary, classical, and scientific education in my native district of Spartanburg."" The college's Main Building is the oldest structure on campus and was designed by the noted Charleston architect Edward C. Jones. In 1941, the college was awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest academic honor society, and the Beta of South Carolina chapter was the first at a private college in South Carolina.
The academic year consists of a four-month fall semester, a one-month January term called the Interim, and a four-month spring semester.
Wofford is ranked 77th in US News &amp; World Report's list of the best national liberal arts colleges, a ranking that has improved in the last 10 years. In 2010, Forbes ranked it 58th on its Forbes List of America's 650 Best Colleges.

It was named in honor of shipping and rail magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who provided the school its initial $1 million endowment despite having never been to the South. Vanderbilt hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the Civil War.
Today, Vanderbilt enrolls approximately 12,000 students from all 50 U.S. states and over 90 foreign countries in four undergraduate and six graduate and professional schools. Several research centers and institutes are affiliated with the university, including the Vanderbilt Institute for Public Policy Studies, Freedom Forum First Amendment Center, Dyer Observatory, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the only Level I trauma center in Middle Tennessee. With the exception of the off-campus observatory and satellite medical clinics, all of the university's facilities are situated on its 330-acre (1.3 km2) campus in the heart of Nashville, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from downtown. Despite its urban surroundings, the campus itself is a national arboretum and features over 300 different species of trees and shrubs.

222983,Austin College,Sherman,75090-4400,"https://www.austincollege.edu/",222983.JPG,"Austin College is a private liberal arts college affiliated by covenant relationship with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and located in Sherman, Texas, about 60 miles (about 100 km) north of Dallas.
Austin College was profiled in all three editions of renowned education writer and editor Loren Pope's book Colleges That Change Lives, which distinguishes schools having two essential elements: ""A familial sense of communal enterprise that gets students heavily involved in cooperative rather than competitive learning, and a faculty of scholars devoted to helping young people develop their powers, mentors who often become their valued friends.""
The undergraduate student body of Austin College is about 1,300. Students are required to live on campus for the first three years of their education in order to foster a close-knit and community oriented campus lifestyle. Austin College actively promotes study abroad programs; 70% of graduates have at least one international study experience during college, and about 82% of students are involved in research. The college cultivates close interaction between students and professors via a 12:1 student to faculty ratio and an average class size of fewer than 25 students. The college has no teaching assistants, so regular faculty teach all levels of coursework.
Chartered in November 1849, Austin College remains the oldest institution of higher education in Texas to be operating under its original charter and name as recognized by the State Historical Survey Committee.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,TX,2,6,13,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,66,0,1,5,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,2,4,0,1,1,0.5128,560,660,550,650,610,600,24,29,22,30,22,27,27,26,25,1233,1293,41155,41155,14066,13311,7578,1,0.0310536643237674,0.4803,57355,51878,43834,36859,69727,37629,87636,30737,57258,25,243,1250,12752,1400,9250,1580,0.723680939981603,0.4741,0.1021,0.2428,0.1268,0.0031,0.0031,0.0309,0.0116,0.0054,0.26652452,0.15565032,0.170575693,0.157782516,0.249466951,12,0,0,0.0259,0,0,0.0148,0,0.0333,0,0,0,0,0.0481,0,0,0.0704,0,0,0.1556,0.0259,0,0.0519,0,0.0111,0,0.0407,0,0.0889,0,0,0.0926,0,0,0,0,0.0259,0.0704,0.2,0.0444,1,33.646345,-96.596331,0.587239502,-1.685924021,2.9,1,C,53235,56557,53235,38092,36842,35116,33006,25843,28762.7043601728,4.78363368827417,0.175205891403655,7768.49647128688,4,0.928339778503407

Snow College is operated as part of the Utah System of Higher Education.
Founded in 1888 by local citizens as Sanpete Stake Academy, the school was later renamed Snow Academy to honor leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Lorenzo Snow and Erastus Snow. It is one of the oldest junior colleges west of the Mississippi. The name was changed to Snow College in 1923. The college was transferred from the LDS Church to the State of Utah in 1931.[1]
The college has an enrollment of approximately 5,100 students. In addition to the main (82 acres (330,000 m2)) Ephraim campus, Snow College maintains the Snow College Richfield Campus (56 acres (230,000 m2)) in Richfield, Utah.
The science and engineering programs are very strong. The Utah State Board of Regents granted permission in 2016 for Snow College to offer a bachelor's degree in software engineering, and interest in the program is robust.
Snow College athletic teams, known as the Badgers, are consistently highly ranked; its football team went undefeated and won the National Junior College Championship in 1985, with the team inducted into the NJCAA Hall of Fame in 2010,[2] and finished #2 in 2006. Its football players often go on to play at FBS Division schools.
In addition to athletics, Snow College has a notable music program. The Horne School of Music has been an accredited member of the National Association of Schools of Music since 1997, and is also an All Steinway School.[3] Some Snow College music graduates go on to play in some of the finest groups and colleges in the world. In addition, Snow hosts a number of music camps held annually.[4] In 2012, the Horne School of Music began offering the first baccalaureate program in the history of the college, a Bachelor of Music degree in Commercial Music.
The theatre arts program at Snow College is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre and is affiliated with the Juilliard Drama Division. It regularly produces five major productions each year as well as a student produced season of Black Box productions and a summer program featuring instructors from the Juilliard Drama Division. The graduates from the theatre arts program are regularly accepted into upper division and graduate programs nationally and are frequently found in professional theatre companies and businesses throughout the United States.

The college is on 3,250 acres (13,152,283 m2) in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, on the former estate of the college's founder, Indiana Fletcher Williams. Sweet Briar was established in 1901 as the Sweet Briar Institute and opened its doors in 1906. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts in Teaching, and Master of Education.
On March 3, 2015, Sweet Briar's board of directors announced that the college would be closing at the end of the summer session, citing ""insurmountable financial challenges"". In response, a group of concerned alumnae and friends of the college formed a nonprofit organization, Saving Sweet Briar, to reverse the board's decision. Saving Sweet Briar, students, parents and alumnae, faculty and staff, and the local Commonwealth Attorney all filed lawsuits to enjoin the closing, one of which reached the Virginia Supreme Court. On June 20, 2015, the Virginia Attorney General announced a mediation agreement to keep Sweet Briar College open. After replacing the board and president, the college rescinded the closing announcement. In January 2016, the college announced that it had received more than 1000 applications for the 2016-2017 academic year, and that it did not plan to touch the $16 million of restricted funds initially planned to be released from the endowment by the attorney general.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,VA,2,5,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,0,0,0,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1,0.7942,540,630,470,580,585,525,21,27,22,27,18,25,24,25,22,1139,334,22020,22020,11750,24953,6806,0.8627,0.0677817611603952,0,48425,42042,37213,27544,57050,31796,71338,24874,54328,2,74,1300,13200,2850,7100,2850,0.371911649115691,0.7425,0.0868,0.0599,0.024,0.001,0.003,0.018,0.0359,0.0299,0.340425532,0.19858156,0.127659575,0.092198582,0.241134752,8,0,0,0.0385,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0769,0,0,0,0,0.0769,0.1923,0,0.0385,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0769,0,0,0.1538,0,0,0,0,0.0769,0,0.2308,0.0385,1,37.556725,-79.081014,0.655488508,-1.38022407,2.7,2,C,33270,39370,33270,17215,16627,14378,11444,7175,13475.7390354227,3.77355590681334,0.0788599684387721,14990.9946184064,6,-0.114152526227793

While VMI has been called the West Point of the South, it differs from the federal service academies in several respects. For example, the living conditions at VMI are far more austere than at the service academies.

234207,Washington and Lee University,Lexington,24450-2116,"https://www.wlu.edu/",234207.jpg,"Washington and Lee University (Washington and Lee or W&amp;L) is a private liberal arts university in Lexington, Virginia, United States.
Washington and Lee's 325 acre campus sits at the heart of Lexington and abuts the Virginia Military Institute in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Allegheny Mountains. The campus is approximately 50 miles from Roanoke, Virginia, 140 miles from Richmond, Virginia, and 180 miles from Washington, D.C.
Washington and Lee was founded in 1749 as a small classical school named Augusta Academy (later Liberty Hall Academy) by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers, though the University has never claimed any sectarian affiliation. In 1796, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock, one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at the time. In gratitude, the school was renamed for the first United States President. In 1865, after his surrender at Appomattox Court House, former General Robert E. Lee served as president of the college until his death in 1870, prompting the college to be renamed as Washington and Lee University.

Depending on the program, CPTC offers up to a two-year, Associate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree. In fall 2014, the college launched its first applied baccalaureate program with its Bachelor of Applied Science in Manufacturing Operations. Details are available from the college’s web site, below. The college is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.
Since 2002 the college has undergone an extensive construction program to convert what was once a World War II navy supply base into a modern, pedestrian-oriented campus. The College employs 431 full- and part-time faculty, exempt and classified salaried employees.
CPTC recently created the Northwest Career &amp; Technical High School. NWC&amp;THS provides an innovative program which allows high school students to complete their diploma while simultaneously taking classes in their career program. In Fall of 2003 NWCTHS opened with 21 students. In 2005 it had 16 graduates. The NWC&amp;THS currently has around 200 students.
The college was created by the Clover Park School District in 1942 as a vocational school to train 3,500 civilians as auto mechanics for the nearby McChord Field and Fort Lewis Army Post, and shipfitters, welders and blueprint readers for Tacoma shipyards.
After the war training was expanded to include aircraft mechanics, and Civil Aeronautics Administration certification. In 1954 the vocational school moved to its current location, and since has added over 50 training programs in a wide range of specialties.
Originally named ""Clover Park Vocational Technical Institute,"" in 1991 the school became Clover Park Technical College when the Washington state legislature passed the workforce training bill, converting the state's five two-year vocational schools into technical colleges, and joining them with the state's 29 community colleges.
The school is the home of I-91 FM-KVTI, a 50,000 watt, student operated radio station and ""CollegeVision"" (Comcast ch28 and Click! ch89) which is an educational cable channel available in Pierce County.
The CPTC campus was the site of Tacoma Speedway prior to World War II.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,WA,1,8,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,3,Csb,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,4,0,0,0,0.784138499999999,449.516666666667,555.243333333333,441.168333333333,538.191666666667,503.921666666667,490.533333333333,16.185,21.1283333333333,14.5133333333333,20.82,15.6633333333333,20.4516666666667,18.8116666666667,17.455,18.095,1003.78833333333,1894,5740,5740,1928,5192,6086,0.9944,0.591127194768576,0.4366,34589,34544,33690,19328.1629807069,51958,16349,53595,18331,49133,41,591,840,8695.76333333333,3160.42333333333,9690,3210,0.384299939283446,0.4826,0.1172,0.1294,0.0639,0.0069,0.0148,0.1167,0.0121,0.0565,0.654294804,0.180805939,0.093849417,0.044008484,0.027041357,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0104,0.2271,0.0389,0.0187,0,0.0835,0,0,0,0,0.0073,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0067,0,0,0.0088,0.1799,0.0669,0.028,0.0202,0.2665,0.0373,0,1,47.176084,-122.497873,0.823377994,-2.137991211,2.5,1,C,19480,18436.1866666667,19480,7937,6260,3827,839,0,12107.144601401,5.7517686803731,-0.033784870956246,13304.091835293,8,-0.763385323497654

236188,Olympic College,Bremerton,98337-1699,"https://www.olympic.edu/",default.png,"Olympic College is an urban-based, but rural- and urban-serving, 2-year public institution in Bremerton, in the U.S. state of Washington.
Olympic College opened its doors as Olympic Junior College on September 5, 1946. The main building was located in Bremerton, Washington. They had 575 students (423 men and 152 women) and the tuition was $35 per quarter or students had the option to pay for three quarters in advanced for $75.
Olympic College serves Kitsap and Mason counties in Washington. The college's service area contains two major naval installations: Naval Base Kitsap and Naval Hospital Bremerton.
The college's main campus is a 33-acre (13 ha) site located in Bremerton, Washington, and its two satellite campuses are located in Poulsbo and Shelton, Washington. The Poulsbo campus is a 20-acre (8.1 ha) site and is 15.9 miles (25.6 km) from the main campus, while the 27-acre (11 ha) Shelton campus is located 38.4 miles (61.8 km) from the main campus. These three campuses serve more than 12,000 students a year mainly from the 281,374 residents of Kitsap and Mason counties spread over 1,617 square miles (4,190 km2) of wooded and lowland mountain terrain (Census 2000). The student body is predominantly full-time (59%), between the ages of 20–29 (37.7%), and slightly more female than male (56% female). At 73% white, the student body is more diverse than the two counties in which its campuses are located (Kitsap 84% white, Mason 89%), and is more like Seattle (70% white) in King County, which is an hour's ferry ride from Bremerton across the waters of Puget Sound.
The land for both the Shelton and Poulsbo campuses was donated. The 27 acres of land that is now the Shelton campus was donated by Simpson Timber in 1991 and the 20 acres of land that is now the Poulsbo campus was donated by the Olhava Family in 1993.
The school motto is, ""Cogita, Aspira, Aude, Perade (think, aspire, dare, achieve).""
Olympic College has attracted dignitaries and well-known performers during its history. Harry S Truman, the 33rd President of the United States, visited Bremerton and Olympic College (then known as Olympic Junior College) in 1948. He received the first honorary degree from the college that year.
The college offers bachelor's degrees in Nursing, Information Systems, and Organizational Leadership and Technical Management. Through partnerships with local universities like Washington State University and Western Washington University, students can complete and associate degree with Olympic College then transfer into a partner program to earn a bachelor's degree without having to leave Kitsap County.
In 2015, Olympic College was named as one of ten finalists for the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence, the nation’s preeminent recognition of high achievement and performance in America’s community colleges.
For their inaugural season in 2012, the Kitsap Admirals used the Bremer Student Center as their home venue.

239105,Marquette University,Milwaukee,53233,"https://www.marquette.edu/",default.png,"Marquette University /mɑːrˈkɛt/ is a private, coeducational Catholic university located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the central United States. Established by the Society of Jesus as Marquette College on August 28, 1881, it was founded by John Martin Henni, the first Bishop of Milwaukee.
The university was named after 17th-century missionary and explorer Father Jacques Marquette, with the intention to provide an affordable Catholic education to the area's emerging German immigrant population. Initially an all-male institution, Marquette became the first coed Catholic university in the world in 1909, when it began admitting its first female students.
Marquette is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. The university is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and currently has a student body of about 12,000. Marquette is one of the largest Jesuit universities in the United States, and the largest private university in Wisconsin.
Marquette is organized into 11 schools and colleges at its main Milwaukee campus, offering programs in the liberal arts, business, communications, education, engineering, law and various health sciences disciplines.

243744,Stanford University,Stanford,94305,"https://www.stanford.edu/",243744.jpg,"Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2) campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.
The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford was a former Governor of California and U.S. Senator; he made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students 125 years ago on October 1, 1891, as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.
Stanford University struggled financially after Leland Stanford's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Following World War II, Provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley. The university is also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.
There are three academic schools that have both undergraduate and graduate students and another four professional schools. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. It has gained 112 NCAA team championships, the second-most for a university, 483 individual championships, the most in Division I, and has won the NACDA Directors' Cup, recognizing the university with the best overall athletic team achievement, for 22 consecutive years, beginning in 1994–1995.
Stanford faculty and alumni have founded a large number of companies that produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue, equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world.

446048,Ave Maria University,Ave Maria,34142-9505,"https://www.avemaria.edu/",446048.png,"Ave Maria University (AMU) is a private Catholic university in Southwest Florida, United States, founded in 2003. The university moved to its permanent campus, situated in the planned town of Ave Maria, 17 miles (27 km) east of Naples, Florida, in August 2007. Ave Maria University shares its history with the former Ave Maria College in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which was founded in 1998 and closed in 2007.
Tom Monaghan, Ave Maria's founder, was the founder of Domino's Pizza. In 2007, Monaghan drew criticism from Catholics both inside and outside the university when he removed theologian Joseph Fessio as provost.
The current enrollment of Ave Maria University is 1,072 students, with 1,019 undergraduate students and 53 graduate students on its campus. The university has seen major growth in recent years and hopes to grow to an enrollment of 1,500 by the year 2020, though President Towey reportedly has guessed the 1,500 student enrollment target could come as early as 2017. The university had a satellite campus in Nicaragua called the Ave Maria University-Latin American Campus, but sold the campus to Keiser University in July 2013. Ave Maria ran the Nicaraguan campus for 13 years. Ave Maria University fields athletic teams known as the Gyrenes. It is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and competes within The Sun Conference.
Academically, the university is rated in ""Tier 2"" by U.S. News &amp; World Report, below 178 other liberal arts colleges in the US. It is included in The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College. In 2015, College Factual ranked Ave Maria University as a Top 10 college in the state of Florida. In December 2015, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools renewed Ave Maria University's accreditation.",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,FL,2,5,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,1,Aw,0,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,3,0,1,1,0.8485,530,630,510,600,580,555,20,28,20,28,18,26,24,24,22,1155,1093,21854,21854,7292,9470,7630,1,0.0650170483804266,0.4758,45789,41547,37523,23635,64298,26531,64871,23167,51333,9,212,1260,11990,2905,11990,2905,0.581802162523351,0.6295,0.0467,0.1391,0.0284,0.0037,0.001,0.001,0.0393,0.1134,0.194860814,0.128479657,0.117773019,0.201284797,0.357601713,12,0,0,0.0082,0,0.0041,0.0246,0,0,0,0.0205,0,0,0.0082,0,0,0.0205,0.041,0,0.1639,0,0,0,0.0246,0.0164,0.1066,0.0123,0,0.1066,0,0,0.0615,0,0,0,0,0.0287,0.1025,0.2049,0.0451,1,26.335983,-81.438945,0.459649615,-1.42137773,2.8,4,A,38009,38009,38009,24594,23078,22283,19007,16588,20941.9188208376,4.39356377051051,0.117042735862483,10064.5500231426,6,-0.0216295930218099

The institution has its origins dating to 1884, although it has changed significantly since 2012. Two established institutions were merged and became a new ""state college"" in 2013, and on July 1, 2015 that state college was renamed as Middle Georgia State University. The academic programs of the two legacy institutions were consolidated, and online classes were added to open those programs to more citizens on and off the campuses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,GA,1,5,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,0,0,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,0,1,1,0.9416,450,550,430,540,500,485,16,21,14,21,16,20,19,18,18,990,7123,4042,11389,3874,7215,6117,0.7838,0.267963071497556,0.4368,36432,33325,32536,20557,50307,21565,53341,19224,48064,50,1032,1250,8260,2787,8260,4324,0.295483533422431,0.4982,0.36,0.0541,0.0243,0.001,0.0011,0.0414,0.0157,0.0042,0.514925373,0.182338309,0.131094527,0.09800995,0.073631841,19,30,0,0,0,0,0.0193,0,0.1013,0,0.0241,0,0.0105,0.008,0,0,0.0096,0.2307,0,0.0193,0.0024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0531,0.033,0.0161,0.0024,0,0.0273,0,0.0603,0.0048,0.2621,0.1045,0.0113,1,32.808092,-83.732058,0.572609227,-1.461400102,2.57866666666666,1,C,17876,23686,25223,6980,6203,3871,2064,1321,9169.58920075974,4.57088394542591,-0.110167940846975,14701.7940395611,8,-0.965875444611195

485111,Georgia Military College,Milledgeville,31061,"https://www.edu/index.cms",485111.jpg,"Georgia Military College (GMC) is divided into the junior college, a military junior college program, high school, and middle school in Milledgeville, Georgia. It was originally known as Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College, until 1900.
GMC's main facility is the recently restored old Georgia state capitol building (circa 1807)]] --&gt; The main campus in Milledgeville serves approximately 254 full-time, resident ROTC Cadets and 1300 commuter students. GMC's seven campuses, five extension campuses, and online campus across Georgia serves nearly 14,000 students.
GMC is one of five military junior colleges that participates in the U.S. Army's Early Commissioning Program. Students who graduate from GMC's two-year, military science-oriented curriculum receive an officer's commission in the U.S. Army. Although GMC is a state funded institution, it is not part of the University System of Georgia or the Technical College System of Georgia. The junior college was established in 1879, and later added a preparatory school for students in sixth grade through twelfth grade.
