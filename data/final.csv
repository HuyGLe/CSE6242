Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.
Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering, managing $332 million in 2011 in sponsored research. Its 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi (18 km) northeast of downtown Los Angeles. First-year students are required to live on campus, and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus House System at Caltech. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks, student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division III's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
Caltech is frequently cited as one of the world's best universities. Caltech alumni and faculty include 34 Nobel Prizes (Linus Pauling being the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes), 1 Fields Medalist, 6 Turing Award winners, 4 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and 71 have won the United States National Medal of Science or Technology. There are 112 faculty members who have been elected to the United States National Academies. In addition, numerous faculty members are associated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as NASA. According to a 2015 Pomona College study, Caltech ranked number one in the U.S. for the percentage of its graduates who go on to earn a PhD.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,CA,1,2,8,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Csb,1,2,1,1,1,3,2,3,2,0,0,740,760,790,800,750,795,35,36,35,36,35,36,36,36,36,1557,938,54600,54600,19794,105185,20595,1,0.001,1,112166,108118,129420,48173,181259,67501,175675,64906,204209,10,151,1428,16644,2091,14631,4311,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,3,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.137349,-118.125878,0.595809138,-2.061685503,3.6,1,1,1,C,74970,74763,74970,66628,68328,64042,59296,23233,121381.49068323,0.200757659146041,3.82496542096461,3.38641253746283,1

It was incorporated in 1961 as the first degree-granting institution of higher learning in the United States created specifically for students of both the visual and the performing arts. It is authorized by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) to grant Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts in the visual, performing, and, since 1994, literary arts. The Herb Alpert School of Music at CalArts was accredited in 2009 to grant a Doctor of Musical Arts.
The school was first envisioned by many benefactors in the early 1960s, staffed by a diverse array of professionals (including Nelbert Murphy Chouinard, a founder of Chouinard Art Institute, Walt Disney, Lulu Von Hagen, Thornton Ladd and others). The institute was started as an interdisciplinary ""Caltech of the arts"", with all schools under one roof. CalArts provides a collaborative environment for a diversity of artists.

It is one of the institutions of the contiguous Claremont Colleges, which share adjoining campus grounds. The college's mission is: ""Harvey Mudd College seeks to educate engineers, scientists, and mathematicians well versed in all of these areas and in the humanities and the social sciences so that they may assume leadership in their fields with a clear understanding of the impact of their work on society.""
Harvey Mudd College shares university resources such as libraries, dining halls, health services, and campus security, with the other institutions in the Claremont Colleges, including Pitzer College, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Pomona College, Claremont Graduate University, and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences, but each college is independently managed by its own faculty, board of trustees, and college endowment and has its own separate admissions process. Students at Harvey Mudd College are encouraged to take classes (acceptable for academic credit at Harvey Mudd College) at the other four undergraduate Claremont colleges, especially classes outside their major of study. Together the Claremont Colleges provide the resources and opportunities of a large university while enabling the specialization and personal attention afforded by the individual colleges. The Bachelor of Science diploma received at graduation is issued by Harvey Mudd College.
The college is named after Harvey Seeley Mudd, one of the initial investors in the Cyprus Mines Corporation. Although involved in the planning of the new institution, Mudd died before it opened.

As California's oldest private research university, USC has historically educated a large number of the region's business leaders and professionals. In recent decades, the university has also leveraged its location in Los Angeles to establish relationships with research and cultural institutions throughout Asia and the Pacific Rim. An engine for economic activity, USC contributes $8 billion annually to the economy of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and California.
For the 2014–15 academic year, there were 18,740 students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs. USC also has 23,729 graduate and professional students in a number of different programs, including business, law, engineering, social work, and medicine. The university is one of the top fundraising institutions in the world, consistently ranking among the top 3 in external contributions and alumni giving rates. Multiple academic rankings list the University of Southern California as being among the top 25 universities in the United States. With an acceptance rate of 16 percent, USC is also among the most selective academic institutions in the nation.
USC maintains a strong tradition of innovation and entrepreneurship, with alumni having founded companies such as Lucasfilm, Myspace, Salesforce.com, Intuit, Qualcomm, Box, Tinder, and Riot Games. As of 2014, the university has produced the fourth largest number of billionaire alumni out of all undergraduate institutions in the world.
USC is home to the world’s most powerful quantum computer, which is presently housed in a super-cooled, magnetically shielded facility at the USC Information Sciences Institute. The only other commercially available quantum computing system is operated jointly by NASA and Google. USC was also one of the earliest nodes on ARPANET and is the birthplace of the Domain Name System. Other technologies invented at USC include DNA computing, dynamic programming, image compression, VoIP, and antivirus software.
USC sponsors a variety of intercollegiate sports and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Pac-12 Conference. Members of the sports teams, the Trojans, have won 102 NCAA team championships, ranking them third in the nation, and 378 NCAA individual championships, ranking them second in the nation. Trojan athletes have won 288 medals at the Olympic games (135 golds, 88 silvers and 65 bronzes), more than any other university in the United States. If USC were a country, its athletes would have collectively received the 12th-most Olympic gold medals in history.

130794,Yale University,New Haven,6520,"https://www.yale.edu/",130794.png,"Yale University is an American private Ivy League research university in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in 1701 in Saybrook Colony to train Congregationalist ministers, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.
The ""Collegiate School"" moved to New Haven in 1716, and shortly after was renamed Yale College in recognition of a gift from British East India Company governor Elihu Yale. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century the school introduced graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.
Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, including the Yale Bowl, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forest and nature preserves throughout New England. The university's assets include an endowment valued at $25.4 billion as of June 2016, the second largest of any U.S. educational institution. The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.
Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and are organized into a social system of residential colleges. Almost all faculty teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. Students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League.
Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 20 living billionaires, and many heads of state. In addition, Yale has graduated hundreds of members of Congress and many high-level U.S. diplomats. 52 Nobel laureates, 5 Fields Medalists, 247 Rhodes Scholars, and 119 Marshall Scholars have been affiliated with the University.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,CT,1,2,1,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,1,0,720,770,740,800,745,770,33,35,35,36,31,35,34,36,33,1517,6089,55500,55500,18096,57231,19830,1,0.001,0,88655,75144,72046,47968,132539,60311,146102,41296,117746,76,886,1050,16600,3495,14564,3087,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,6,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.311158,-72.926688,0.721015725,-1.272810818,3.7,1,1,1,C,74201,76645,74201,71775,72253,71733,62408,30483,66354.2162162162,0.200757659146041,2.92098663592953,3.68729868454787,1

UD is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land-grant, sea-grant, space-grant and urban-grant state-supported research institution.
UD is classified as a research university with very high research activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The university's programs in engineering, science, business, hospitality management, education, urban affairs and public policy, public administration, agriculture, history, chemical and biomolecular engineering, chemistry and biochemistry have been highly ranked with some drawing from the historically strong presence of the nation's chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the state of Delaware, such as DuPont and W. L. Gore and Associates. It is one of only four schools in North America with a major in art conservation. In 1923, UD was the first American university to offer a study abroad program.
The school from which the university grew was founded in 1743, making it one of the oldest in the nation. However, UD was not chartered as an institution of higher learning until 1833.

In addition, it was ranked in the top 10 of the best Catholic colleges in the country, and has been recommended by the Cardinal Newman Society in The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College. It was described as one of the 25 most underrated colleges in the United States.
CUA's programs emphasize the liberal arts, professional education, and personal development. The school stays closely connected with the Catholic Church and Catholic organizations. The American Cardinals Dinner is put on by the residential U.S. cardinals each year to raise scholarship funds for CUA.

In his will, Washington left his 50 shares in the Potomac Company to help endow the university. However, due to the company's financial difficulties, the funding did not materialize. The university was chartered by an act of Congress on February 9, 1821, as Columbian College. Its name was changed to Columbian University in 1873 and to the George Washington University in 1904, in honor of Washington.
The university has ten colleges and schools: the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences (which includes the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, the School of Media and Public Affairs, and the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration); the School of Business, the Elliott School of International Affairs, the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the College of Professional Studies (which includes the Graduate School of Political Management), the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences, the Law School, the School of Nursing, and the Graduate School of Education and Human Development.
GW's Graduate School of Political Management is the only school of applied politics in the nation's capital. GW's professional schools and the Elliott School of International Affairs are consistently ranked highly in national and international college rankings lists.
The Princeton Review consistently ranks GW as one of the ""Most Politically Active"" schools. Some of the university's graduates have gone on to high positions within both the U.S. government and foreign governments. Notable alumni include former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,DC,1,2,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,5,Cfa,1,2,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,0,630,720,650,750,675,700,30,33,31,35,27,31,32,33,29,1395,12031,56935,56935,32762,23624,14691,0,0.001,0,80606,72295,62584,48576,99848,51690,117606,41126,83472,153,3274,1400,14300,1525,14300,1525,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,13,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.89923,-77.048363,0.67891964,-1.344747618,3.4,1,1,1,C,74160,74160,74160,54088,53778,49415,42420,25130,59789.9083746717,0.200757659146041,1.33080628513668,2.78464024329275,2

Founded in 1789 as Georgetown College, the university has since grown to incorporate nine undergraduate and graduate schools, including the School of Foreign Service, School of Business, a Medical Center and a Law School. Georgetown's main campus is located on a hill above the Potomac River. It is recognizable by its flagship Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark that towers over Washington's Georgetown neighborhood.
Georgetown offers degree programs in forty-eight disciplines, enrolling an average of 7,500 undergraduate and 10,000 post-graduate students from more than 130 countries. The university is especially known for preparing leaders for careers in government and international affairs. As of 2015, Georgetown produced more diplomats for the U.S. Foreign Service than any other school in the country, and has ranked second in the U.S. by the average number of graduates serving in the U.S. Congress. Georgetown's notable alumni include U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, CIA Director George Tenet, actor Bradley Cooper, King Felipe VI of Spain, as well as the royalty and heads of state of more than a dozen countries.
Georgetown is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit-affiliated institution of higher education in the United States. The Jesuits have participated in the university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805; however, the university has always been governed independently of the church. At present, the majority of Georgetown students are not Catholic.
Georgetown is home to the country's largest student-run business, as well as the largest student-run financial institution. The school’s athletic teams, nicknamed the Hoyas, include a men's basketball team that has won a record-tying seven Big East championships, appeared in five Final Fours, and won a national championship in 1984, as well as a co-ed sailing team that holds nine national championship and one world championship title.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,DC,1,2,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,0,690,760,690,790,725,740,31,35,33,36,29,34,33,35,32,1473,7141,56058,56058,39098,31693,15798,0,0.001,0,96375,81408,71107,54512,126349,61372,147685,44875,98256,128,1814,1200,16466,2556,15072,2294,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,11,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.908809,-77.073463,0.679086825,-1.345185695,3.6,1,1,1,C,74624,76280,74624,68592,65162,59907,50005,26166,66420.2358393409,0.183710037482315,1.62071279155276,3.38641253746283,1

Since its founding as a junior college in 1946, Florida College has drawn its staff, faculty, and the majority of its students from non-institutional churches of Christ. It is also recognized among these churches as an important training center for ministers. Because non-institutional churches of Christ, as a matter of doctrine, oppose congregational support for colleges, Florida College has some unique characteristics as religious colleges go – the college accepts no direct contributions from any congregation or other organized religious body, and its board members serve as individuals rather than as official representatives of any such entity.
The high emphasis Florida College places on its Christian heritage is expressed in its tradition of daily chapel services. All members of the board of directors and all faculty members are required to be active members in a Church of Christ.

NWFSC was founded in 1963 as Okaloosa-Walton Junior College, with its campus in Valparaiso, Florida; students started class the next year. A permanent campus in Niceville was built and started serving students with the 1969–70 academic year.
The school voted to change its name to Okaloosa-Walton Community College in 1988, and gained four-year status in 2003, thus changing its name to Okaloosa-Walton College.
In June 2008, Florida Governor Charlie Crist signed a bill that allowed several community colleges, including OWC, to offer four-year degrees and be considered part of Florida's upper education under the newly formed Florida College Pilot Project making OWC one of the state colleges in Florida. Due to the change, school officials elected to once again change the name this time to Northwest Florida State College.

Seminole State is the eighth-largest member institution of the Florida College System.
Founded in 1965, the Florida State Legislature signed a charter creating ""Seminole Junior College."" The college opened in August 1966 with 700 students at a former citrus grove in Seminole County, near U.S. Route 17/92 and County Road 427 (Ronald Reagan Blvd.) now in the city of Sanford. By October 1971, Seminole Junior College's enrollment had exceeded 7,000, and by 1975, Seminole Junior College became ""Seminole Community College"", with enrollment reaching 14,161. In 2006, Seminole Community College partnered with the University of Central Florida to launch ""DirectConnect to UCF"", which guarantees Seminole Community College (SCC) graduates admission to the university, as well as academic advising by university counselors. In September 2009, the SCC Board of Trustees unanimously approved a motion to rename the institution ""Seminole State College of Florida,"" eight months after the introduction of the institution's first state-approved bachelor's degree program, the Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.) in interior design.
As of 2011, the college serves over 30,000 students, full-time and part-time, and is also one of the largest employers in Seminole County. The college has expanded into four campuses since 1965, all based within Seminole County, Florida. Its main campus is located in Sanford, and its satellite campuses are located in Oviedo, Altamonte Springs and Heathrow. The Oviedo campus opened in 2001, the Heathrow in 2007, and the Altamonte Springs in 2008.

It is the state's land-grant and primary research university. The University of Idaho was the state's sole university for 71 years, until 1963, and its College of Law, established in 1909, was first accredited by the American Bar Association in 1925.
Formed by the territorial legislature on January 30, 1889, the university opened its doors in 1892 on October 3, with an initial class of 40 students. The first graduating class in 1896 contained two men and two women. It presently has an enrollment exceeding 12,000, with over 11,000 on the Moscow campus. The university offers 142 degree programs, from accountancy to wildlife resources, including bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and specialists' degrees. Certificates of completion are offered in 30 areas of study. At 25% and 53%, its 4 and 6 year graduation rates are the highest of any public university in Idaho, and it generates 74 percent of all research money in the state, with research expenditures of $100 million in 2010 alone.
As a land-grant university and the primary research university in the state, UI has the largest campus in the state at 1,585 acres (6.4 km2), located in the rolling hills of the Palouse region at an elevation of 2,600 feet (790 m) above sea level. The school is home to the Idaho Vandals, who will compete on the Division I FBS (formerly I-A) level through the 2017 season, and will drop down to the FCS level in 2018.

The university, established in 1890, is composed of the College, various graduate programs, and interdisciplinary committees organized into five academic research divisions and seven professional schools. Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago is also well known for its professional schools, which include the Pritzker School of Medicine, the Booth School of Business, the Law School, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, the Divinity School and the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. The university currently enrolls approximately 5,700 students in the College and around 15,000 students overall.
University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics; the Chicago school of sociology; law and economics theory in legal analysis; the Chicago school of literary criticism; the Chicago school of religion; and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction (Chicago Pile-1) beneath the viewing stands of university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.
Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and widely considered the wealthiest American in history John D. Rockefeller, the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890; William Rainey Harper became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892. Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility. With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities, an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.
The University of Chicago has many prominent alumni. 92 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the university as professors, students, faculty, or staff, the fourth most of any institution in the world. Similarly, 34 faculty members and 16 alumni have been awarded the MacArthur “Genius Grant”. In addition, Chicago's alumni include 50 Rhodes Scholars, 22 Marshall Scholars, 9 Fields Medalists, 20 National Humanities Medalists, 13 billionaire graduates, and a plethora of members of the United States Congress and heads of state of countries all over the world.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,IL,1,2,3,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,5,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,0,730,770,770,800,750,785,33,35,35,36,31,35,34,36,33,1528,6801,60552,60552,30967,85108,18547,1,0.001,1,76730,68397,62671,42289,111040,51584,125653,36543,101041,80,1300,1800,17004,2175,14816,2958,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,5,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.787994,-87.599539,0.729338083,-1.528900379,3.6,1,1,1,D,80126,81531,80126,75843,75755,70621,60626,35399,59037.8985507246,0.200757659146041,3.15465492724725,3.38641253746283,1

Following in the footsteps of its founders, DePaul places special emphasis on recruiting first-generation students and others from disadvantaged backgrounds.
DePaul's two main campuses are located in Lincoln Park and the Loop. The Lincoln Park Campus is home to the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, Science and Health, and Education. It also houses the School of Music, the Theatre School, and the John T. Richardson Library. The Loop campus houses the Colleges of Communication, Computing and Digital Media, and Law, as well as the School of Public Service and the School for New Learning. It is also home to the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business, which is part of the nationally ranked Driehaus College of Business - the tenth oldest business school in the nation. The Loop campus also houses the Loop Library and the Rinn Law Library.
The university enrolls around 16,000 undergraduate and about 7,600 graduate/law students, making DePaul the 13th largest private university by enrollment in the United States, and the largest private university in Illinois. The student body represents a wide array of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including over 60 foreign countries.
DePaul's intercollegiate athletic teams, known as the Blue Demons, compete in the Big East Conference.

In French, Notre Dame du Lac means ""Our Lady of the Lake"" and refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary. The main campus covers 1,250 acres (5,100,000 m2) in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks, such as the Golden Dome, the ""Word of Life"" mural (commonly known as Touchdown Jesus), and the Basilica. The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president, as an all-male institution on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes (Indiana). Today, many Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including the president of the university.
Notre Dame is a large, four-year, highly residential research university. It is consistently ranked among the top twenty universities in the United States and as a major global university and is highly regarded for its undergraduate education.

The university offers over 50 foreign study abroad yearlong programs and over 15 summer programs. Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master, doctoral and professional degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and scientific museums, including the Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of Art. The university boasts one of the largest Navy ROTC programs in the nation. Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events, and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni, considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.
Notre Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish football team under the guidance of legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent with no conference affiliation, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame, 13 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is one of the most famed and successful college football teams in history. Other ND sport teams, chiefly in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships. The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable collegiate fight song.
Started as a small all-male institution in 1842 and charter in 1844, Notre Dame reached international fame at the beginning of the 20th century. Major improvements to the university occurred during the administration of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh between 1952 and 1987 as Hesburgh's administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic programs, and reputation and first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972. Ever since, the University has seen steady growth, and under the leadership of the next two presidents, Rev. Malloy and Rev. Jenkins, many infrastructure and research expansions have been completed.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,IN,2,2,3,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,1,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,0,680,760,720,790,720,755,32,35,33,35,30,35,34,34,33,1490,8689,55553,55553,25579,32634,14604,1,0.001,1,88962,80006,76123,57082,116194,59531,131654,49003,100369,81,1855,1050,15640,1950,15640,1950,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.999,9,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.703058,-86.238959,0.72785567,-1.505153778,3.5,1,1,2,D,74193,74193,74193,59282,56171,54012,47388,27233,72938.1017561983,0.175186226650452,1.62498061948864,3.08552639037779,2

Oakland City University is the only General Baptist Church-affiliated college in the United States. Its founding was in 1885; it has slowly grown to the present student enrollment of about 120 on the main campus and, counting all sites, about 2,000 total. OCU's teams, called the Oaks, play in the NCCAA (National Christian College Athletic Association) and NCAA Division II, where they are strong and have won many CCNIT national titles over the years.
In addition to the institution's Oakland City Main Campus, the university has satellite campuses in Indianapolis, Evansville, Rockport and Bedford where they hold classes for busy adults. The Bedford branch is housed in the former headquarters of the Indiana Limestone Company. These sites utilize the adult learning model that emphasizes experiential application to objectives and theory. Students from a wide age range attend, learning from three sources: the texts, their instructors (who work in the field they teach), and from each other. Courses are provided in an accelerated pace and condensed format, much like how summer school operates in more traditional programs. Students may take one or two courses at a time and enroll as full-time. They focus on learning business techniques and communication skills which build stronger career skills that can easily be translated to working situations. Another program strength comes from flexibility to transfer credits from prior accredited learning.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,IN,1,2,3,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,105,0,1,1,Cfa,1,2,1,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,1,460,570,460,560,515,510,16,21,15,22,16,21,19,19,19,1023,602,24300,24300,24002,3855,5733,0,0.001,1,37286,37615,36933,22269,51950,23723,53527,22769,51158,9,199,1458,10400,3816,7106,3816,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,12,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.340891,-87.35144,0.669174786,-1.524570234,2.6,1,1,3,C,36680,39974,36680,28950,29638,24037,21554,19202,35334.9375,0.183710037482315,-0.654033620668899,-0.488834725783687,7

Valpo consists of five undergraduate colleges, a graduate school, and a law school. It is the largest independent Lutheran university in the United States and is home to the second-largest collegiate chapel in the world, the Chapel of the Resurrection.
Originally named Valparaiso Male and Female College, Valparaiso University was founded in 1859 as one of the first coeducation colleges in the United States. Due to reverses brought about by the Civil War, the college was forced to close its doors in 1871. Two years later it was revived by educator Henry Baker Brown and named Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute. At the turn of the 20th century, Brown changed the college's name to Valparaiso College, and shortly after it was rechartered as Valparaiso University. Initially founded by Methodists, in 1925 the school was purchased by the Lutheran University Association, which continues to operate it today.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,IN,1,2,3,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,1,1,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,540,640,530,650,590,590,22,29,21,29,22,28,26,25,25,1202,2965,41820,41820,14808,10903,7866,1,0.001,0,55837,51170,47544,33521,75003,36837,78491,33216,65996,39,1039,1200,12260,1620,8900,1620,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.462239,-87.040172,0.723652586,-1.519137583,3,1,1,2,D,53540,56900,53540,38319,36994,34246,30696,27397,45823.948051948,0.183710037482315,0.0561963329208861,0.714709862556465,4

Founded in 1801 as Jefferson Academy, VU is the oldest public institution of higher learning in the Northwest Territory and in Indiana. Since 1889, VU has been a two-year university, although baccalaureate degrees in seven select areas are available. Unlike most other two-year higher-education institutions, however, the VU's campus in Vincennes is a residential campus and has been since its establishment. VU was chartered in 1806 as the Indiana Territory's four-year university and remained the state of Indiana's sole publicly funded four-year university until the establishment of Indiana University in 1820.

Founded in 1891 as Buena Vista College, it is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. The university's 60-acre (240,000 m2) campus is situated on the shores of Storm Lake, a 3,200-acre (13 km2) natural lake. BVU's academic programs feature a balance between traditional liberal arts courses and hands-on learning opportunities, such as travel and internships. The average student-to-professor ratio is 13:1.
At its inception, the college was housed in the Storm Lake Opera House, where it remained for only a year. Old Main, the college's first building, opened in 1892, and was occupied by faculty and students until it burned down in 1956. Major construction projects in the 1950s and 1960s extended the college, which soon included three dormitories, a library, and a number of classroom buildings.
The college gained accreditation in 1952, and began to grant degrees under the authority of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The first graduate degrees were offered in 1995, at which time the college became Buena Vista University.
The main campus of Buena Vista University offers a 4-year residential collegiate experience and currently offers classes in 42 majors. Seventeen additional locations throughout Iowa and online serve working adult and graduate students as part of the Graduate &amp; Professional Studies program.

157100,Kentucky Christian University,Grayson,41143-1199,"https://www.kcu.edu/",default.png,"Kentucky Christian University (KCU) is a comprehensive baccalaureate level Christian university located in Grayson, Kentucky. It was founded on December 1, 1919, as Christian Normal Institute, by J. W. Lusby and J. O. Snodgrass. As a ""normal school"" its programs included a high school, a junior college, and a training program for public school teachers. During the early 1920s its emphasis shifted to educating students for the Christian ministry. Degree programs are offered in eight schools within the university: the School of Art and Science, the Sack School of Bible and Ministry, the School of Business, the Keeran School of Education, the School of Music, the Yancy School of Nursing, the School of Social Work and Human Services, and the Graduate School.
KCU is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is authorized to award bachelor's and master's degrees. All programs requiring professional licensure (i.e. Nursing, Social Work, and Teacher Education) are professionally accredited.
Every graduate of KCU takes a 24-hour core in Biblical Studies, in addition to the liberal arts core and the student's major area of study (social work, education, ministry, etc.) This combination of biblical studies, liberal arts, and professional studies is a feature unique to Kentucky Christian University. It is the rationale for KCU's self-designation as ""The Great Commission University.""

Louisiana Tech opened as the Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana in 1894 during the Second Industrial Revolution. The original mission of the college was for the education of students in the arts and sciences for the purpose of developing an industrial economy in post-Reconstruction Louisiana. Four years later in 1898, the state constitution changed the school's name to Louisiana Industrial Institute. In 1921, the college changed its name to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute to reflect its evolution into a larger and more capable institute of technology. Under the leadership of Dr. F. Jay Taylor, the college continued to grow and change over time. Louisiana Polytechnic Institute became desegregated in the 1960s and officially changed its name to Louisiana Tech University in 1970 as the school developed into a research university.
Louisiana Tech enrolled 12,694 students in five academic colleges during the Fall 2016 academic quarter including 1,400 students in the graduate school. In addition to the main campus in Ruston, Louisiana Tech holds classes at the Louisiana Tech University Shreveport Center, Cyber Innovation Center in Bossier City, Barksdale Air Force Base, and on the CenturyLink campus in Monroe.

In 1913, the institution was renamed Hood College by its Board of Trustees to honor its most generous benefactor, Margaret Scholl Hood, whose land donation allowed the school to move from rented facilities in downtown Frederick to its own campus in the northwest region of the city.
An all-female institution until 1971, the college initially admitted men only as commuters. This continued until 2003, when male students were extended the option of residential status. The influx of new students has led to major changes at the school, including extensive dormitory renovations, and the construction of a new athletic building and a new tennis and aquatic center.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,MD,1,2,2,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,2,Cfa,1,2,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,1,513,617,507,605,567,559,20,26,19,26,18,25,23,23,22,1133,1106,41060,41060,15503,10888,7820,0,0.001,0,51779,45129,41188,27745,63505,35174,70509,27162,54543,21,478,1248,12880,3262,12066,3262,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.420631,-77.419049,0.688019804,-1.351217309,2.6,1,1,1,C,57636,58450,57636,40658,39771,33512,25309,21605,39454.6372745491,0.183710037482315,-0.206015323808933,-0.488834725783687,7

Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His $7 million bequest—of which half financed the establishment of The Johns Hopkins Hospital—was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States.
Johns Hopkins is organized into 10 divisions on campuses in Maryland and Washington, D.C. with international centers in Italy, China, and Singapore. The two undergraduate divisions, the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and the Whiting School of Engineering, are located on the Homewood campus in Baltimore's Charles Village neighborhood. The medical school, the nursing school, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health are located on the Medical Institutions campus in East Baltimore. The university also consists of the Peabody Institute, the Applied Physics Laboratory, the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, the School of Education, the Carey Business School, and various other facilities.
Johns Hopkins was a founding member of the American Association of Universities. The University was ranked 10th among undergraduate programs at national universities, and 11th among global universities by U.S. News &amp; World Report in its 2017 rankings, as well as 17th globally in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Over the course of almost 140 years, thirty-six Nobel laureates have been affiliated with Johns Hopkins. Founded in 1883, the Blue Jays men’s lacrosse team has captured 44 national titles and joined the Big Ten Conference as an affiliate member in 2014.",0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,MD,1,2,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,0,710,760,750,800,735,775,33,35,34,36,30,35,34,35,33,1514,5729,55350,55350,27244,86752,14576,1,0.001,0,83287,78204,75418,48949,109993,58878,119776,45906,100325,169,2652,1250,16310,1118,12235,1118,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,6,70,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.328977,-76.621595,0.68642014,-1.337299111,3.6,1,1,1,C,69953,74028,69953,68375,63691,62852,52724,28388,70899.8709677419,0.200757659146041,2.49464171019183,3.38641253746283,1

Established as Loyola College in Maryland by John Early and eight other members of the Society of Jesus in 1852, it is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the ninth-oldest Jesuit college in the United States, and the first college in the United States to bear the name of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus.
Loyola's main campus is in Baltimore and features Collegiate Gothic architecture, as well as a pedestrian bridge across Charles Street. Academically, the university is divided into three schools: the Loyola College of Arts and Sciences, the Loyola School of Education, and the Sellinger School of Business and Management. It operates a Clinical Center at Belvedere Square in Baltimore and has graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.
The student body is composed of approximately 4,000 undergraduate and 1,900 graduate students, representing 34 states and 20 countries, and 84% of undergraduates reside on campus. The average class size is 25, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1. Approximately 73% of the student body receives some form of financial aid. Campus groups include the Association of Latin American &amp; Spanish students (ALAS) and the college newspaper, The Greyhound.
Notable alumni include Tom Clancy, author of The Hunt for Red October, and Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down. Loyola's sports teams are nicknamed the Greyhounds and are best known for the perennially ranked men's and women's lacrosse teams. The men's lacrosse team's biggest rival is nearby Johns Hopkins University.

Founded in 1887 with a large endowment from its namesake Jonas Gilman Clark, a prominent businessman, Clark was one of the first modern research universities in the United States. Originally an all-graduate institution, Clark's first undergraduates entered in 1902. The university now offers 46 majors, minors, and concentrations in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering and allows students to design specialized majors and engage in pre-professional programs. It is noted for its programs in the fields of psychology, geography, physics, biology, and entrepreneurship and is a member of the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts which enables students to cross-register to attend courses at other area institutions including Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the College of the Holy Cross. As a liberal arts-based research university, Clark makes substantial research opportunities available to its students, notably at the undergraduate level through LEEP project funding, yet is also respected for its intimate environment as the second smallest university counted among the top 75 national universities by U.S. News &amp; World Report and as one of 40 Colleges That Change Lives.
Graduate and professional programs are offered through the Graduate School, the Graduate School of Management, the Graduate School of Geography, the Frances L. Hiatt School of Psychology, the Gustaf H. Carlson School of Chemistry, the Adam Institute for Urban Teaching and School Practice, the International Development, Community and Environment Department, and the School of Professional Studies.
The university competes intercollegiately in 17 NCAA Division III varsity sports as the Clark Cougars and is a part of the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference. Intramural and club sports are also offered in a wide range of activities.
Clark was ranked no. 27 on the U.S. News list of Best Value Schools and no. 16 on the Forbes list of America's most entrepreneurial universities. Its faculty and alumni have founded numerous companies and organizations including Panera Bread, the American Psychological Association, and the American Physical Society, and have played leading roles in the development of modern rocketry, the wind chill factor, and the birth control pill. The university is also the alma mater of at least three living billionaires, in addition to its alumni having won two Pulitzer Prizes and an Emmy Award.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,MA,1,2,1,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,3,Dfb,1,2,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,1,1,550,650,531,637,598,581,22,28,21,29,20,27,25,25,24,1195,2283,47200,47200,20813,13842,11071,1,0.001,0,54506,45851,40331,31177,63976,30898,76352,25395,60499,24,526,800,9480,950,9170,1050,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,11,60,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.249987,-71.823356,0.737401382,-1.253554042,3.2,1,1,1,D,58220,58430,58220,33627,35780,34793,30446,19598,38571.1018181818,0.183710037482315,0.710074667769746,1.31648215672654,3

The college is widely known for its alternative curriculum, socially liberal politics, focus on portfolios rather than distribution requirements, and reliance on narrative evaluations instead of grades and GPAs. In some fields, it is among the top undergraduate institutions in percentage of graduates who enroll in graduate school. Fifty-six percent of its alumni have at least one graduate degree and it is ranked 30th among all U.S. colleges in the percentage of its graduates who go on to attain a doctorate degree (notably first among history doctorates).",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,MA,1,2,1,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,3,Dfb,0,2,2,2,2,2,4,1,3,1,0,556,655,522,640,607,587,22,29,22,30,20,27,26,26,23,1201,745,52068,52068,21894,13958,9320,1,0.001,0,41407,39692,28187,18208,59119,20359,62746,15924,43215,28,344,850,14120,1050,12120,1050,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.325852,-72.531469,0.738725476,-1.265912945,2.9,1,0,2,D,66088,68088,66088,46021,43049,43510,37309,25560,26065.3978494624,0.183710037482315,0.44818746991241,1.28020950786756,3
166027,Harvard University,Cambridge,2138,"https://www.harvard.edu/",166027.jfif,"Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636, whose history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities.
Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.
The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's $34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution.
Harvard is a large, highly residential research university. The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the University's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages. It operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums, alongside the Harvard Library, which is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars. To date, some 130 Nobel laureates, 18 Fields Medalists, and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students, faculty, or staff.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,MA,1,2,1,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,0,710,770,750,800,740,775,33,35,34,36,31,36,34,35,34,1517,7547,51925,51925,35910,46272,20988,1,0.001,1,84918,74271,77816,45980,135753,56301,153746,41980,136374,126,1709,1000,17682,3193,15357,3295,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,6,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.374471,-71.118313,0.739574038,-1.24124872,3.6,1,1,1,D,71577,73800,71577,70512,72475,70074,57932,27325,72472.7760217984,0.200757659146041,2.93668163904754,3.38641253746283,1

Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin.
The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. For several years, MIT's School of Engineering has been ranked first in various international and national university rankings, and the Institute is also often ranked among the world's top universities overall. The ""Engineers"" compete in 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.
As of 2015, 85 Nobel laureates, 52 National Medal of Science recipients, 65 Marshall Scholars, 45 Rhodes Scholars, 38 MacArthur Fellows, 34 astronauts, 19 Turing award winners, 16 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and 6 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT.

175227,Dunwoody College of Technology,Minneapolis,55403-1192,"https://www.dunwoody.edu/",175227.jpg,"Dunwoody College of Technology is a private, non-profit vocational college in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In addition to associate 2-year college programs Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.), Dunwoody also offers a Bachelor of Science in Applied Management for students with an associate degree.
Dunwoody offers programs and courses in Drafting and Estimating, Interior Design, Computer Networking, Programming, Electrical, Automotive Mechanics, Heating / Air Conditioning Systems Design, Food Science Technology, Electronics, Automated Systems and Robotics, Machine Tooling, Industrial Controls, Land Surveying, Construction Management, Graphic Design, Appliance Service and Printing, and Welding.
Dunwoody Institute was founded in 1914, when Minneapolis businessman William Hood Dunwoody left three million dollars in his will to ""provide for all time a place where youth without distinction on account of race, color or religious prejudice, may learn the useful trades and crafts, and thereby fit themselves for the better performance of life's duties."" When his widow, Kate L. Dunwoody, died a year later she left additional funds to keep the college moving forward.
In the spring of 1916, the Dunwoody Trustees purchased six city blocks, 3 long and 2 deep, facing the parade grounds. The Minneapolis City Council closed the streets and alleys that traversed the area creating a site of approximately 16 acres (6.5 ha). Hewitt and Brown Architects and Engineers were contracted to design a school building. Their draft included nine buildings which were composed of six shop buildings and a three-story administration facility with an auditorium on one side and a gymnasium building on the other.
Three years from the school’s inception, the first two buildings were opened in August 1917 and have remained throughout the century. In issues of the Artisan from this period, the Minneapolis Public Library had one of its branches on the campus offering its services the campus’s students. Located across from St. Mary’s Basilica and Loring Park, just west of downtown, the new facility was dedicated on October 31, 1917 and the space at the Minneapolis Central High School facility was left empty. Dr. Marion L. Burton, president of the University of Minnesota, gave the address. Dr. Prosser’s commencement address in May 1918 contrasted the new facility with the old one used in cooperation with the Minneapolis school district, “Roughly four years ago we were quartered in an old, tumble-down building that, with the kindness of the board of education, served us well in time of need.” 
When the University of Minnesota perceived its need for preparing instructors to teach in this new emerging area of vocational education, they began to look for partnerships. On April 22, 1920, Fred Snyder, President of the University of Minnesota, entered into a cooperative agreement with William Hood Dunwoody Institute allowing students who were enrolled at the University in teacher training courses to spend a portion of their class time at the institute to receive experiences related to observations and practice of all types of trade and industrial education. The reciprocity of this agreement allowed Dunwoody instructors to enroll and receive credit for any courses offered by the College of Education at the University that were a part of the teacher training authorized by the Smith Hughes Act. These matriculations were considered scholarships and did not encumber the University or the Institute in monetary exchanges, only the awarding of credits. There were no other recognizable post-secondary technical institutes or colleges at this time in the state of Minnesota.
In 1953, the era of the international perspective of Dunwoody Industrial Institute became manifest when Dunwoody was provided a grant by the Ford Foundation for the purpose of sending representatives to consult with the Indonesian Ministry of Education. Under the leadership of Dunwoody Industrial Institute’s second Director J. R. Kingman, an Indonesian Technical Teacher Training Institute was to be established in Ban dung, Java. An American, Dr. Milton G Towner was the advisor and director for the center. He was on leave as director of the Staff College of the Federal Civil Defense Administration in Washington, DC. Six American teachers from Dunwoody were sent with Dr. Towner to work with indigenous Indonesians in making training available to prospective and interested teachers in the Indonesian technical school system. Seven Indonesian teachers were sent to Dunwoody for training so they could return and support the efforts being directed by Dr. Towner. On November 27, 1953, Dr. K. Nagaraja Rao, a graduate of the University of Mysore, India, became the head of Dunwoody Industrial Institute’s new International Services Division. He was a native of India who taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the Korean Technical Institute, where he opened a department of chemical engineering. His job was to be the liaison between the Indonesia project and the Ford Foundation. Since 1951, he had been a consultant to the Government of Indonesia for the development of indigenous industries.
Mr. Phillip S. Van Wyck became the senior advisor of the Government Technical Institute in Insein, Burma. The development and operation of this government Technical Institute was funded by the Ford Foundation and assisted with staffing from Dunwoody. In 1956, Dunwoody Industrial Institute began its third technical assistance program in the Union of Burma, establishing the first technical high school in Rangoon. In a government-sponsored building, four Dunwoody employees assisted the local Burmese in developing shops, curriculum and demonstration materials. Burmese instructors were delivered the curriculum. The Annual Report of the Ford Foundation noted Dunwoody Institute’s efforts at Insein and Rangoon. It also it noted that a second Teacher’s Institute was started in Djakarta.
The Central Training Institute in Bombay India was opened in March 1963 with the assistance of a five-member team from Dunwoody, the Indian Government and the US Department of Education. In the Dunwoody News March 29, 1963 issue, a facsimile of the formal invitation indicating that Prime Minister Nehru of India would be addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Institute is found. That year another project began in Khartoum, Sudan, to establish the Khartoum Senior Trade school which opened in December 1964. Dr. Rao left Dunwoody Industrial Institute in 1965 to become a program officer for the Ford Foundation in the foundation’s Latin American program after a twelve-year tenure at the institute. Robert R. Minarik, a graduate of the Dunwoody electronics program and the University of Minnesota, replaced Rao, bringing his experience overseas from Burma and Saudi Arabia.
In 1967 Dunwoody began overseas programs with funding from private industries rather than foundations or United States Government sponsorship. The first initiative was with the Alumina Partners of Jamaica known as ALPART. Contracting directly with Dunwoody Institute, they desired the institute to organize and implement a training school for construction and maintenance workers. This ALPART Training Center for Industrial Skills was to serve the ALPART aluminum plant in Nain in South Central Jamaica. A senior team of Dunwoody employees would begin to train and set in place Jamaican personnel as trainers. Time-release training aimed at select job targets were dovetailed with on- the-job training and specific customized training manuals. This partnership came to a successful conclusion in the fall of 1972. During this time, a nine-member Dunwoody team worked with Esso Standard Libya Inc at the Marsa el Brega terminal in Libya. This refinery and production complex provided an opportunity for developing curriculum for and also operating ESSO’s Industrial Training Center. Further east in Saudi Arabia, the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) began a long-term training relationship that lasted into the 80’s. New hardware and software for basic and mid-level electric and electronic training at the Ras Tanura Industrial Training shops were targeted. The curriculum developed here was transferable to two other sites: one in Dhahran and the other in Abqaiq. Freeport Indonesia Inc hired a Dunwoody team to help in their copper mining project in Irian Jaya. The objective here was to assist in the training of the indigenous Indonesian work force as electrical, mechanical, and mobile machinery operators at the town site of Tembaga Pura. These mining facilities were remote, the Indonesians were from jungle tribes, and the size of the enterprise larger than Dunwoody Institute had ever attempted before.
In 2000, Dr. Jane Plihal, associate professor and chair of the Department of Work, Community and Family Education at the College of Education and Human Development reevaluated the 1920 “Cooperative Agreement Between Dunwoody Industrial Institute and the University of Minnesota.” She proposed a termination of the agreement. Plihal perceived the University’s perception of the agreement as anachronistic and no longer expressive of the ways in which the two institutions had been cooperating or could cooperate at the end of the century. A notice of termination for this agreement, signed on December 28, 2000 by Robert H Bruininks, Executive Vice President and Provost, voided the reciprocity agreement between the two institutions at the end of summer session 2001.
In 2003, Dunwoody Institute merged with NEI College of Technology of Columbia Heights, Minnesota, which specialized in electronics and computer technology. NEI's operations were moved to the Dunwoody campus and the old campus was sold and demolished. The combined institution was renamed Dunwoody College of Technology.
In 2004, the college took decisive steps to diversify a student body that had long been almost exclusively white and male, hiring a director of diversity and increasing the percentage of students of color to 20%.
In 2007, the college sponsored a new charter high school in North Minneapolis, Dunwoody Academy.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,MN,1,2,4,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,2,Dfa,0,2,2,2,2,2,3,1,3,1,1,512,626,509,623,567,567,20,26,19,25,19,26,23,23,22,1145,1338,23119,23119,21304,13530,6333,1,0.001,1,54095,51656,52848,33974,71571,35717,73647,34258,71149,12,611,791,11268,2250,11268,2250,0,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,11,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,44.97281,-93.290608,0.784923608,-1.628228271,2.6,1,0,1,D,37428,37428,37428,8524,8713,5286,4630,1567,0,0.183710037482315,-0.147884328750257,-0.488834725783687,7

The main campus is located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, with a second campus located in the Tradition community near Gulfport, Mississippi and Biloxi, Mississippi.
In the 2017 edition of U.S. News &amp; World Report’s America’s Best Colleges, William Carey University was ranked No. 2 Best Value among regional universities in the South for the second consecutive year. In 2015, William Carey University was ranked No. 1 Best Value among regional universities in the South.
William Carey University was founded by W. I. Thames in 1892 as Pearl River Boarding School in Poplarville, Mississippi. A disastrous fire destroyed the school in 1905, and in 1906, with the backing of a group of New Orleans businessmen, Thames re-opened the school in Hattiesburg as South Mississippi College. Another fire destroyed the young institution, forcing it to close. In 1911, W. S. F. Tatum acquired the property and offered it as a gift to the Baptists, and the school re-opened as Mississippi Woman's College. In 1953, the Mississippi Baptist Convention voted to move the college into coeducational status, which necessitated a new name for the institution. In 1954, the board of trustees selected the name of William Carey College in honor of William Carey, the eighteenth century English cobbler-linguist whose decades of missionary activity in India earned him international recognition as the “Father of Modern Missions.” The school changed to university status in 2006.
The university offers baccalaureate degrees in the areas of arts and letters, education, natural and behavioral sciences, business, religion, music, and nursing. The university also offers M.B.A, M.Ed., M.S. in psychology, M.S. in Health Information Systems, and an M.S.N. degree, as well as a specialist degree in elementary education and a Ph.D. in education administration.

With more than 30 undergraduate and seven graduate degree programs, College of Saint Mary offers associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees in high-demand majors such as occupational therapy, physician assistant studies, nursing, biology, business, education and legal studies. The student-to-faculty ratio is 10:1.
In 2004 CSM launched the largest campaign in its history, the $25 million Campaign for CSM. This effort was designed to provide critical resources in three key areas: Endowment building, growth of the annual scholarship fund and campus/facility improvements. The goal of $25 million was surpassed by the fall of 2009, yielding the transformation of the Campus Park (2006), the addition of Hixson-Lied Commons (2007), as well as the modernization of Walsh Hall (2007) and the renovation of CSM's Math and Science Building (2008). Hixson-Lied Commons is the location of CSM's Library as well as Christina's Place, a cafe offering coffee, breakfast and lunch options.
Since 2009, CSM's enrollment has been over 1,000 students and the residence halls have experienced record numbers in both 2010 and again in 2011 with 223 students living on-campus. The burgeoning residence halls and the need for additional OT laboratory space led to a $10 million campaign to build a new residence hall. CSM broke ground on the new residence hall in 2010, and Madonna Hall opened in 2012 to serve the Mothers Living &amp; Learning program.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,NE,1,2,4,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,30,0,1,2,Dfa,0,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,1,0,512,617,507,608,563,558,20,26,19,26,18,25,23,23,22,1133,800,20750,20750,12718,7995,6722,0,0.001,0,48273,46894,47387,30535,64348,31760,67147,33850,64618,2,162,848,7850,2934,10548,3654,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,10,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,41.240028,-96.021425,0.719774272,-1.675890019,2.6,1,1,1,D,35800,32382,35800,19237,21845,17975,12822,10214,46809.1097560976,0.183710037482315,-0.454428516859886,0.377551066612448,5

The school was founded as Plymouth Normal School in 1871. Since that time it has evolved to a teachers college, a state college, and finally to a state university in 2003. PSU is part of the University System of New Hampshire.
It was founded as a teachers' college, and it still retains a teaching program/major to this day. Since that time, however, it has diversified its academic profile, adding many new majors and fields of study. The school has become known in recent years for its meteorology program (Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute), and is also strong in business, visual and performing arts, interdisciplinary studies, and psychology. Also, new majors such as criminal justice and nursing have been added and other programs have increased their stature, especially the natural sciences with the creation of The Center for the Environment.
Plymouth State is one of 311 institutions of higher learning nationwide included on the Carnegie Foundation Community Engagement Classification. According to Carnegie, PSU was honored for ""excellent alignment of mission, culture, leadership, resources, and practices that support dynamic and noteworthy community engagement."" Community service has long been a mainstay of the Plymouth State experience. The university’s motto, Ut prosim (That I may serve), underscores the values upon which the Plymouth State University mission is built. During the 2009–10 academic year, PSU students contributed approximately 220,000 hours to service.
The campus has grown substantially in recent years with the addition of the PSU Ice Arena and Welcome Center, the Museum of the White Mountains, Enterprise Center at Plymouth, and ALLWell North, a 107,600 square foot academic and athletics facility that includes a 200-meter indoor track. Langdon Woods, PSU's most recent residence hall, was one of the first collegiate residence halls in the U.S. to gain “Gold” certification by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high performance green buildings. Robert Frost, America's Poet Laureate, lived and taught at Plymouth from 1911 to 1912. The university's campus newspaper, The Clock, was the first college newspaper in the nation to have a Sudoku puzzle.
Plymouth State gained national attention in 1985 when Sports Illustrated featured PSU student and football player Joe Dudek as their favorite to win the Heisman Trophy. Dudek, a running back for the Panthers, earned the attention for breaking Walter Payton's mark for career touchdowns.",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,NH,1,1,1,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,3,Dfb,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,513,620,509,611,567,561,20,26,20,26,19,26,23,23,23,1142,3779,14440,23330,9750,8472,8694,0,0.001,1,48110,48272,40529,34325,68773,34022,66907,29433,60271,24,1075,1310,11350,2330,11350,2330,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,16,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.759573,-71.690164,0.763748628,-1.251229403,2.6,1,1,3,D,29430,38320,38320,12388,11542,10619,6242,4196,39643.9262966333,0.183710037482315,0.0621197652544193,-0.488834725783687,7

Founded in 1889 by Abbot Hilary Pfrängle, O.S.B. of Saint Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey, at the request of Bishop Denis Mary Bradley of Manchester, New Hampshire, it is the third-oldest Catholic college in New England. Named for Saint Anselm of Canterbury (Archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1109), the college continues to have a fully functioning and independent Benedictine abbey attached to it, Saint Anselm Abbey. As of 2015, its enrollment is approximately 2,000.

According to the college, the student body is selected not only for their academic abilities but also for their personal character. The college's academic curriculum requires several philosophy and theology courses, as well as the new ""Conversatio"" program. The administration's commitment to an anti-grade inflation policy helped the college receive national media attention from the Fox News Channel in 2006, as well as a Tier 1 ranking from U.S. News and World Report, which in 2016 ranked the college 112th among national liberal arts colleges, with an admissions rate that is deemed ""selective"" at 73.7%. U.S. News &amp; World Report also ranked the college as the most popular New Hampshire venue for presidential candidates.Forbes magazine has ranked St. Anselm as the 85th best college in the nation, as well as the 40th in the Northeast. In 2015, Saint Anselm was recognized by Time magazine as one of the ""50 Best Liberal Arts Colleges"" in the nation.
Since the 1950s, the college has played an important role in the ""first in the nation"" New Hampshire primary, and has served as the national stage for many future presidents, candidates, and supporters. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon each delivered important policy speeches there. The college has been home to several national presidential debates which have attracted extensive media attention. The Washington Post recently referred to Saint Anselm College as ""the Benedictine college with a box seat on America's most riveting political theater"".

184348,Drew University,Madison,7940,"https://www.drew.edu/",default.png,"Drew University is a coeducational private university located in Madison, New Jersey, in the United States. Drew has been nicknamed the ""University in the Forest"" because of the serenity of its wooded 186-acre campus (753,000 m2) when compared to the busy suburban area surrounding the school. As of 2015, 2,113 students are pursuing degrees at the university's three schools. Undergraduate tuition for the 2015–2016 academic year was US$59,661 (excluding books, personal expenditures, and health insurance), making Drew among the most expensive universities in New Jersey.
In 1867, financier and railroad tycoon Daniel Drew purchased an estate in Madison to establish a theological seminary to train candidates for ministry in the Methodist church. The seminary later expanded to offer an undergraduate liberal arts curriculum in 1928 and graduate studies in 1955. The College of Liberal Arts, serving 1,417 undergraduate students, offers strong concentrations in the natural sciences, social sciences, languages and literatures, humanities and the arts and in several interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields. The Drew Theological School, the third-oldest of thirteen Methodist seminaries affiliated with the United Methodist Church, currently enrolls 436 students preparing for careers in the ministry and the academic study of theology. The Caspersen School of Graduate Studies, enrolling 351 graduate students, offers masters and doctoral degrees in a variety of specialized and interdisciplinary fields.
While affiliated with the Methodist faith, Drew University makes no religious demands of its students.

Kean is also noted for the physical therapy program which it holds in conjunction with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
Kean University was founded in 1855 in Newark, New Jersey, as the Newark Normal School. Initially established for the exclusive purpose of being a teacher-education college it became New Jersey State Teachers College in 1937. In 1958, following a post-war boom of students and increasing demands for a more comprehensive curriculum, the college was relocated from Newark to Union Township, site of the Kean family's ancestral home at Liberty Hall. After its move to the historic Livingston-Kean Estate, which includes the entire Liberty Hall acreage, the historic James Townley House, and Kean Hall, which historically housed the library of United States Senator Hamilton Fish Kean and served as a political meeting place, the school became Newark State College, a comprehensive institution providing a full range of academic programs and majors. Renamed Kean College of New Jersey in 1973, the institution earned university status on September 26, 1997, becoming Kean University of New Jersey. Kean University has subsequently grown to become the third largest institution of higher education in New Jersey and currently comprises five undergraduate colleges and the Nathan Weiss Graduate College. Kean University also hosts numerous research institutions, perhaps most prominently the New Jersey Center for Science, Technology and Mathematics, the Kean University Human Rights Institute, the Holocaust Recourse Center, the Wynona Moore Lipman Ethnic Studies Center, and Liberty Hall.

NJIT is New Jersey's Science &amp; Technology University. Centrally located in the New York metropolitan area its campus is within walking distance of downtown Newark. New York City, 9 miles (14.5 km) and under 30 minutes away, is directly accessible from campus via public transit.
Founded in 1881 with the support of local industrialists and inventors, especially Edward Weston (334 US Patents), NJIT opened as Newark Technical School in 1884. Application oriented from inception the school grew into a classic engineering college – Newark College of Engineering (NCE) – and then, with the addition of a School of Architecture in 1973, into a polytechnic university that is now home to five colleges and one school.
NJIT opened with 88 students. As of fall 2016, the university enrolls over 11,300 students, 2,200 of whom live on campus. Architecturally significant buildings include Eberhardt Hall, the Campus Center, and the Central King Building – in the Collegiate Gothic style – which is being renovated into a STEM center. Facilities under construction include a Wellness and Events Center that will house a 3,500-seat venue for social and sporting events.
NJIT offers 50 undergraduate (Bachelor of Science/Arts) majors and 78 graduate (Masters and PhD) programs. Via its Honors College it also offers professional programs in collaboration with several nearby institutions including a program in medicine (BS, MD) with Rutgers Medical School, and an engineering + law program (BS, JD) with Seton Hall Law School.
The university is organized into 21 departments; three of which, Biological Sciences, History, and Theater Arts, are federated with Rutgers-Newark whose campus borders NJIT's. With a student population that is almost 20% international, NJIT ranks among the most ethnically diverse national universities in the country. It has multiple study abroad options along with extensive co-op, internship, and service opportunities. According to PayScale (2016–17) NJIT ranks 20th among Engineering Schools and 33rd among Research Universities in the US by Salary Potential.
NJIT's R&amp;D expenditures were $110 million in 2015 and $131 million in 2016. Areas of focus include: applied mathematics, materials science, biomedical engineering, signal processing, and solar-terrestrial physics – of which the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research is a world leader. A key agent in regional economic development, NJIT hosts the Enterprise Development Center (EDC), an on-campus business incubator that houses over 90 start-ups, and the New Jersey Innovation Institute (NJII) which offers R&amp;D services to business.
NJIT is a member of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, a Sea Grant College, and a member of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. A leader in the graduate education of students that are underrepresented in STEM fields, it has participated in the McNair Scholars Program since 1999.

189097,Barnard College,New York,10027-6598,"https://www.barnard.edu/",189097.jpg,"Barnard College is a private women's liberal arts college in New York City. Founded in 1889 as a response to Columbia University's refusal to admit women into their institution, it is one of the oldest women's colleges in the world, and the only women's college in New York City today. It has been affiliated with Columbia University since 1900.
The school was founded by Annie Nathan Meyer and named after Frederick Barnard, tenth president of Columbia. When Columbia became coeducational in 1983 Barnard elected to remain legally and financially separate but maintained its affiliated relationship with the university. This includes shared academic programs and other academic privileges, and a combined athletic program. Barnard students also receive Columbia University degrees and graduate at Columbia University graduation. Barnard confers the Bachelor of Arts degree in about 50 areas of study. Students may also pursue elements of their education at the Juilliard School and The Jewish Theological Seminary.

190415,Cornell University,Ithaca,14853,"https://www.cornell.edu/",190415.png,"Cornell University (/kɔːrˈnɛl/ kor-NEL) is an American private Ivy League and federal land-grant doctoral university located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge—from the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: ""I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.""
The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar.
Cornell is one of three private land grant universities in the nation and the only one in New York. Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and human ecology colleges. Of Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. As a land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens (more than 4,300 acres) are considered, as well as the numerous university-owned lands in New York City.
Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. Cornell counts more than 245,000 living alumni, and its former and present faculty and alumni include 34 Marshall Scholars, 29 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Truman Scholars, 7 Gates Scholars, 46 Nobel laureates, and 14 living billionaires.

190983,Elmira College,Elmira,14901,"https://www.elmira.edu/",190983.jpg,"Elmira College is a coeducational private liberal arts college located in Elmira, in the U.S. state of New York's Southern Tier region.
The college is noted as among the oldest colleges still in existence which (as a college for women) granted degrees to women that were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the Wesleyan College located in Macon, GA, in 1840). Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.
The college, founded in 1855, has an enrollment of about 1200 students. The school's colors, purple and gold, are seen throughout the traditional campus, consisting mainly of ivy-covered buildings of the Victorian and Collegiate Gothic architectural styles. The colors purple and gold come from both the banners of the women's suffrage movement and the iris, the college flower.
Offered are about thirty-five major areas of study, each ultimately leading to either a B.S. or B.A. degree upon a successful completion of undergraduate studies. Students attend two full terms in the fall and winter and then enroll in a 6-week, intensive ""Term III"" in the spring. This gives students a unique opportunity to study abroad, intern, or take classes not related to their majors so as to enrich the educational experience.
Elmira College has an extensive Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) archive and is one of the only two centers for Mark Twain Studies in the world. The octagonal study from Quarry Farm in which Twain wrote many of his most widely read novels: Life on the Mississippi, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is located on campus. Every four years the college perpetuates his legacy by hosting an international conference on the State of Mark Twain Studies.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,NY,1,2,2,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,5,Dfb,1,2,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,510,610,510,610,560,560,21,25,19,26,19,25,23,22,22,1128,778,35400,35400,17577,10611,5570,1,0.001,0,53878,47605,44979,32225,62895,37196,74233,29219,59478,7,369,600,12500,550,2500,550,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.0961,-76.813459,0.734715547,-1.340647769,2.7,1,1,1,D,39050,49050,39050,37825,40422,33266,29507,29330,44141.625,0.183710037482315,-0.362039637073052,-0.187948578698649,6

In 2005, it adopted what had initially been the name of the whole institution, the New School for Social Research, while the larger institution was renamed The New School.
The New School has launched or housed a range of institutions such as the international research institute World Policy Institute, the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, the India China Institute, the Observatory on Latin America, and the Center for New York City Affairs.

196413,Syracuse University,Syracuse,13244,"https://www.syracuse.edu/",196413.jpg,"Syracuse University, commonly referred to as Syracuse, 'Cuse, or SU, is a private research university in Syracuse, New York, United States. The institution's roots can be traced to the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (later becoming Genesee College), founded in 1831 by the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York. After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as nonsectarian, although it maintains a relationship with The United Methodist Church.
The campus is in the University Hill neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of downtown, on one of the larger hills. Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century Romanesque Revival structures to contemporary buildings. SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges, with nationally recognized programs in information studies and library science, architecture, communications, business administration, inclusive education and wellness, sport management, public administration, engineering and the College of Arts and Sciences.
Syracuse University athletic teams, known as the Orange, participate in 20 intercollegiate sports. SU is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference for all NCAA Division I athletics, except for the men's rowing and women's ice hockey teams. SU is also a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,NY,1,2,2,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfb,1,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,1,0,580,670,600,710,625,655,26,30,25,33,25,30,28,29,28,1291,14854,53849,53849,27650,18538,12051,1,0.001,0,71470,64639,58773,41513,89498,46379,101814,39115,77580,186,4000,1536,15910,1774,15910,1774,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,15,85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.040176,-76.136975,0.751192782,-1.328840896,3.1,1,1,1,D,73069,73069,73069,53226,49030,45692,42468,23492,56161.4906832298,0.183710037482315,1.07118981668125,1.88198180203764,3

198419,Duke University,Durham,27708,"https://www.duke.edu/",198419.png,"Duke University is an American private research university located in Durham, North Carolina. Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established The Duke Endowment, at which time the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke.
Duke's campus spans over 8,600 acres (3,500 hectares) on three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in Beaufort. The main campus—designed largely by architect Julian Abele—incorporates Gothic architecture with the 210-foot (64-meter) Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation. The first-year-populated East Campus contains Georgian-style architecture, while the main Gothic-style West Campus 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) away is adjacent to the Medical Center. Duke is the seventh-wealthiest private university in America with $11.4 billion in cash and investments in fiscal year 2014.
Duke's research expenditures in the 2015 fiscal year were $1.037 billion, the seventh largest in the nation. In 2014, Thomson Reuters named 32 of Duke's professors to its list of Highly Cited Researchers, making it fourth globally in terms of primary affiliations. Duke also ranks fifth among national universities to have produced Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater, and Udall Scholars. Ten Nobel laureates and three Turing Award winners are affiliated with the university. Duke's sports teams compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference and the basketball team is renowned for having won five NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships, most recently in 2015.
Duke is consistently included among the best universities in the world by numerous university rankings, and among the most innovative, according to a Reuters' survey. According to a Forbes study, Duke is ranked 11th among universities that have produced billionaires. In a New York Times corporate study, Duke's graduates were shown to be among the most sought-after and valued in the world, and Forbes magazine ranked Duke seventh in the world on its list of 'power factories' in 2012.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,NC,1,2,5,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,71,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,0,0,720,770,760,800,745,780,33,35,34,36,32,35,34,35,34,1522,6546,58031,58031,29952,68756,16863,1,0.001,0,93115,79843,77260,53443,126716,61558,151838,47579,112796,109,1759,1434,15588,1976,14670,2633,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,6,85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.001135,-78.937624,0.62833834,-1.377721443,3.6,1,1,1,C,76768,77029,76768,82913,76419,70955,56730,26425,72751.7880085653,0.200757659146041,2.58976141243549,3.38641253746283,1

Chartered in 1951, the college is sponsored by the Original Free Will Baptist Convention. The college’s roots and educational philosophy can be traced as early as 1897 when Free Will Baptists in Pitt County, North Carolina, citing a growing need for education in the community, led a discourse on education within the church. These efforts ultimately resulted in the founding of the Ayden Theological Seminary and its successor institution, Eureka College, both in Ayden, North Carolina, to educate ministers and provide a liberal arts education to the local constituency. After a catastrophic fire destroyed the administration building in 1931, Eureka College ceased operations, and the Free Will Baptist church’s efforts to fulfill its educational vision were reinvested in the founding of Mount Olive College. In January 2014 the college changed its name to THE University of Mount Olive.
Mount Olive is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the North Carolina Association of Colleges and Universities, and the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.

It is one of the 17 campuses of the University of North Carolina system. After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, which also allows it to be one of three schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States.
The first public institution of higher education in North Carolina, the school opened its doors to students on February 12, 1795. The university offers degrees in over 70 courses of study through fourteen colleges and the College of Arts and Sciences. All undergraduates receive a liberal arts education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university or within the College of Arts and Sciences from the time they obtain junior status. Under the leadership of President Kemp Plummer Battle, in 1877 North Carolina became coeducational and began the process of desegregation in 1951 when African-American graduate students were admitted under Chancellor Robert Burton House. In 1952, North Carolina opened its own hospital, UNC Health Care, for research and treatment, and has since specialized in cancer care. The school's students, alumni, and sports teams are known as ""Tar Heels"".
The campus covers 729 acres (3 km2) of Chapel Hill's downtown area, encompassing the Morehead Planetarium and the many stores and shops located on Franklin Street. Students can participate in over 550 officially recognized student organizations. The student-run newspaper The Daily Tar Heel has won national awards for collegiate media, while the student radio station WXYC provided the world's first internet radio broadcast. North Carolina is one of the charter members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which was founded on June 14, 1953.

The famous Michelson–Morley interferometer experiment was conducted in 1887 in the basement of a campus dormitory by Albert A. Michelson of Case School of Applied Science and Edward W. Morley of Western Reserve University. This experiment proved the non-existence of the luminiferous ether and was later understood as convincing evidence in support of special relativity as proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. Michelson became the first American to win a Nobel Prize in science. The commemorative Michelson-Morley Memorial Fountain as well as an Ohio Historical Marker are located on campus, near where the actual experiment was performed.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,OH,1,2,3,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Dfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,0,640,720,700,790,680,745,30,34,31,35,29,34,32,33,32,1436,5269,50924,50924,27364,31082,12116,1,0.001,1,78330,69719,65156,44544,95699,52462,106011,38880,87443,59,1061,1200,15614,1900,15614,1900,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,11,70,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.507419,-81.609596,0.724441126,-1.424356151,3.5,1,1,1,D,69638,69638,69638,48569,48243,45041,37670,25382,61723.675,0.200757659146041,1.20116744573282,3.08552639037779,2

Ursuline College is a small, Roman Catholic liberal arts women's-focused college in Pepper Pike, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1871 by the Ursuline Sisters of Cleveland and is one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women in the United States. From 1978 until about 2001 Ursuline admitted men but didn't allow them to live in the dorms. Ursuline College offers a diverse spectrum of undergraduate and graduate studies within the Catholic tradition of education. The college offers 30 undergraduate, 11 graduate programs, and a Doctorate of Nursing Practice. In 2015, Ursuline College had 706 undergraduate and 530 graduate students. Although Ursuline College focuses primarily on the liberal arts, it also offers courses such as nursing and business administration.
The campus is situated approximately 10 miles outside of Cleveland and 30 miles outside of Akron. Ursuline's campus is quite spacious and meticulously landscaped, featuring 12 educational buildings, including the most recently constructed Sister Diana Stano Athletic Center, the Parker Hannifin Center for the Creative Healing Arts &amp; Sciences, and the Bishop Anthony M. Pilla Center.
In July 2013, the O'Brien Athletic Center was destroyed by a tornado that ripped through the campus. With generous donations from the community and insurance payments, a new athletic center was completed for Fall 2015. The Sister Diana Stano Athletic Center offers a fitness space overlooking the campus, a gymnasium, shower and locker rooms for visiting and home athletic teams, offices, and conference rooms. The Parker Hannifin Center for the Healing Arts and Sciences, also completed for Fall 2015 semester, provides educational equipment and classrooms for Nursing and Art Therapy students.
The Pilla Center, the main gathering space has a view of the lake, and is two stories high with windows on adjacent sides, and a luminescent stained glass window that faces the main quadrangle. It has a new dining hall, staffed by Metz Culinary Management, that offers a food court.
The college's Florence O'Donnell Wasmer Gallery is host to changing display of professional and student artwork exhibits, and remains open for public consumption Tuesday through Sunday in the afternoon.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,OH,1,2,3,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,30,0,1,1,Dfb,1,2,1,2,1,2,4,1,3,1,1,483,558,470,548,521,509,17,23,17,23,16,23,20,20,20,1044,633,33440,33440,16657,12010,6193,0,0.001,0,55319,49649,48546,31255,64372,34976,72272,29824,63512,7,227,1200,11126,1800,6450,5000,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,41.497035,-81.465118,0.724259891,-1.421834535,2.7,1,1,2,D,46090,47566,46090,29806,27556,27305,26612,22990,47093.7692307692,0.183710037482315,-0.555702830112067,-0.187948578698649,6

All students of the College are undergraduates, and nearly all reside on campus.
The college was founded in 1833 by area members of the Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) to ensure an education grounded in Quaker values for young Quaker men. Although the college no longer has a formal religious affiliation, Quaker philosophy still influences campus life. Originally an all-male institution, Haverford began admitting female transfer students in the 1970s and became fully co-educational in 1980. Currently, more than half of Haverford's students are women. For most of the 20th century, Haverford's total enrollment was kept below 300, but the school went through two periods of expansion during and after the 1970s, and its current enrollment is 1,290 students.
Today Haverford offers its students a wide range of educational choices and considerable flexibility in choosing their areas of study or specialisation. The college offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 31 majors across humanities, social sciences and natural sciences.
Haverford College is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, which allows students to register for courses at both Bryn Mawr College and Swarthmore College. It is also a member of the Quaker Consortium (""Penn-Pal"") which allows students to cross-register at the University of Pennsylvania.
The college has produced, among others, 3 Nobel laureates, 6 Pulitzer Prize Recipients, 20 Rhodes Scholars, and 104 Fulbright Scholars.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,PA,1,2,2,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,2,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,0,680,750,700,790,715,745,32,34,33,36,29,34,33,35,32,1468,1308,56952,56952,30916,27765,10275,1,0.001,0,69192,64598,42959,35333,97106,49629,97831,26830,68034,13,170,1194,16770,1468,16770,1468,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,8,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.007452,-75.305207,0.698261763,-1.314323806,3.4,1,0,2,C,76384,76384,76384,67320,67404,65386,56870,27133,39907.2677595628,0.183710037482315,0.734940319247283,2.78464024329275,2

215062,University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,19104-6303,"https://www.upenn.edu/",215062.png,"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private Ivy League research university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges.
Benjamin Franklin, Penn's founder, advocated an educational program that focused as much on practical education for commerce and public service as on the classics and theology, though his proposed curriculum was never adopted. The university coat of arms features a dolphin on the red chief, adopted directly from the Franklin family's own coat of arms. Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow a multidisciplinary model pioneered by several European universities, concentrating multiple ""faculties"" (e.g., theology, classics, medicine) into one institution. It was also home to many other educational innovations. The first school of medicine in North America (Perelman School of Medicine, 1765), the first collegiate business school (Wharton School of Business, 1881), and the first ""student union"" building and organization (Houston Hall, 1896) were founded at Penn. With an endowment of $10.72 billion (2016), Penn had the seventh largest endowment of all colleges in the United States. All of Penn's schools exhibit very high research activity. In fiscal year 2015, Penn's academic research budget was $851 million, involving more than 4,300 faculty, 1,100 postdoctoral fellows and 5,500 support staff/graduate assistants.
Over its history, the university has also produced many distinguished alumni. These include 14 heads of state (including two U.S. Presidents); 25 billionaires - the most of any university in the world at the undergraduate level; three United States Supreme Court justices; over 33 United States Senators, 42 United States Governors, and 158 members of the U.S. House of Representatives; 8 signers of the United States Declaration of Independence; and 12 signers of the United States Constitution. In addition, some 30 Nobel laureates, 169 Guggenheim Fellows, and 80 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, have been affiliated with Penn. In addition, Penn has produced a significant number of Fortune 500 CEOs, trailing only Harvard and Stanford worldwide.",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,PA,1,2,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,4,1,0,700,760,750,800,730,775,33,35,34,36,32,35,34,35,34,1511,10774,57770,57770,42393,56874,18277,1,0.001,0,103246,92773,80445,57474,146940,65218,174907,48111,125432,129,2454,1358,16190,1946,14406,1946,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,6,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.950929,-75.19391,0.69727525,-1.312381307,3.6,1,1,1,C,75480,77264,75480,72122,70470,62551,54671,33882,76427.4216027874,0.200757659146041,2.63529061441821,3.38641253746283,1

Founded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers from three ""Hicksite"" yearly meetings: Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York. Many of the founders were prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements and other social concerns and included Edward Parrish, (1822–1872), Deborah and Joseph Wharton, Benjamin Hallowell, and James and Lucretia Mott, (1793–1880). Swarthmore was established to be a college, ""...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country."" By 1906, Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation, becoming officially non-sectarian.

These students, later dubbed ""night owls,"" were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple, hence the origin of the university's name and mascot. By 1907, the institution revised its institutional status and incorporated as a university.
In 2015, Temple received $227.5 million in research funding, ranking it 93rd out of 905 institutions in the NSF’s Higher Education Research and Development Survey.

The college traces its origin to three log cabin colleges in Washington County established by three Presbyterian missionaries to the American frontier in the 1780s: John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, and Joseph Smith. These early schools eventually grew into two competing academies and colleges, with Canonsburg Academy, later Jefferson College, located in Canonsburg and Washington Academy, later Washington College, in Washington. These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington &amp; Jefferson College. The 60-acre (24 ha) campus, located in Washington, Pennsylvania, has more than 40 buildings, with the oldest dating to 1793. While the college has historically had a difficult relationship with the city of Washington, including clashes over college expansion and finances, recent efforts have been made to improve those relations.
The college's academic emphasis is on the liberal arts and the sciences, with a focus on preparing students for graduate and professional schools. Campus activities include various religious, political, and general interest clubs, as well as academic and professional-themed organizations. The college has a strong history of competing literary societies, dating back before the union of Jefferson and Washington Colleges. Students operate a college radio station, a campus newspaper, and a literary journal. The athletic program competes in NCAA Division III. The football team has been particularly successful over its history, even competing in the 1922 Rose Bowl. A large majority of students participate in intramural athletics. Nearly all students live on campus and roughly one third are members of fraternities or sororities.

217156,Brown University,Providence,2912,"https://www.brown.edu/",217156.jpg,"Brown University is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, founded in 1764 as ""The College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations."" Brown is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges established before the American Revolution.
At its foundation, Brown was the first college in the United States to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation. Its engineering program was established in 1847 and was the first in the Ivy League. It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding master and doctoral studies in 1887. Brown's New Curriculum is sometimes referred to in education theory as the Brown Curriculum and was adopted by faculty vote in 1969 after a period of student lobbying. The New Curriculum eliminated mandatory ""general education"" distribution requirements, made students ""the architects of their own syllabus,"" and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory or unrecorded no-credit. In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution Pembroke College was fully merged into the university. Pembroke Campus now operates as a place for dorms and classrooms.
Undergraduate admissions is very selective, with an acceptance rate of 9 percent for the class of 2020, according to the university. The University comprises The College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health, and the School of Professional Studies (which includes the IE Brown Executive MBA program). Brown's international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and the university is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design. The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, offered in conjunction with the Rhode Island School of Design, is a five-year course that awards degrees from both institutions.
Brown's main campus is located in the College Hill Historic District in the city of Providence, the third largest city in New England. The University's neighborhood is a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. On the western edge of the campus, Benefit Street contains ""one of the finest cohesive collections of restored seventeenth- and eighteenth-century architecture in the United States"".
Brown's faculty and alumni include eight Nobel Prize laureates, five National Humanities Medalists, and ten National Medal of Science laureates. Other notable alumni include eight billionaire graduates, a U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, four U.S. Secretaries of State and other Cabinet officials, 54 members of the United States Congress, 55 Rhodes Scholars, 46 Marshall Scholars, 14 MacArthur Genius Fellows, 19 Pulitzer Prize winners, members of royal families, as well as leaders and founders of major companies.",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,RI,1,2,1,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,4,1,0,700,770,740,800,735,770,33,35,34,36,31,35,34,35,33,1511,6834,58404,58404,39378,34216,15039,1,0.001,0,78943,76306,60341,47600,138247,51724,135712,37080,96632,83,1187,1632,15332,2122,14542,2194,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,6,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.82617,-71.40385,0.73000438,-1.246232281,3.6,1,1,1,C,76772,77490,76772,73691,67208,62203,52258,30300,56397.4543307087,0.200757659146041,1.65438053640856,3.38641253746283,1

The college's Main Building is the oldest structure on campus and was designed by the noted Charleston architect Edward C. Jones. In 1941, the college was awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest academic honor society, and the Beta of South Carolina chapter was the first at a private college in South Carolina.
The academic year consists of a four-month fall semester, a one-month January term called the Interim, and a four-month spring semester.

Austin College was profiled in all three editions of renowned education writer and editor Loren Pope's book Colleges That Change Lives, which distinguishes schools having two essential elements: ""A familial sense of communal enterprise that gets students heavily involved in cooperative rather than competitive learning, and a faculty of scholars devoted to helping young people develop their powers, mentors who often become their valued friends.""
The undergraduate student body of Austin College is about 1,300. Students are required to live on campus for the first three years of their education in order to foster a close-knit and community oriented campus lifestyle. Austin College actively promotes study abroad programs; 70% of graduates have at least one international study experience during college, and about 82% of students are involved in research. The college cultivates close interaction between students and professors via a 12:1 student to faculty ratio and an average class size of fewer than 25 students. The college has no teaching assistants, so regular faculty teach all levels of coursework.

The college is on 3,250 acres (13,152,283 m2) in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, on the former estate of the college's founder, Indiana Fletcher Williams. Sweet Briar was established in 1901 as the Sweet Briar Institute and opened its doors in 1906. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts in Teaching, and Master of Education.
On March 3, 2015, Sweet Briar's board of directors announced that the college would be closing at the end of the summer session, citing ""insurmountable financial challenges"". In response, a group of concerned alumnae and friends of the college formed a nonprofit organization, Saving Sweet Briar, to reverse the board's decision. Saving Sweet Briar, students, parents and alumnae, faculty and staff, and the local Commonwealth Attorney all filed lawsuits to enjoin the closing, one of which reached the Virginia Supreme Court. On June 20, 2015, the Virginia Attorney General announced a mediation agreement to keep Sweet Briar College open. After replacing the board and president, the college rescinded the closing announcement. In January 2016, the college announced that it had received more than 1000 applications for the 2016-2017 academic year, and that it did not plan to touch the $16 million of restricted funds initially planned to be released from the endowment by the attorney general.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,VA,1,2,5,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,1,1,Cfa,1,2,2,2,1,2,3,1,3,1,1,540,630,470,580,585,525,21,27,22,27,18,25,24,25,22,1139,334,22020,22020,11750,24953,6806,1,0.001,0,48425,42042,37213,27544,57050,31796,71338,24874,54328,2,74,1300,13200,2850,7100,2850,0,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.556725,-79.081014,0.655488508,-1.38022407,2.7,1,1,2,C,33270,39370,33270,17215,16627,14378,11444,7175,0,0.183710037482315,0.0613541636152361,-0.187948578698649,6

Washington and Lee's 325 acre campus sits at the heart of Lexington and abuts the Virginia Military Institute in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Allegheny Mountains. The campus is approximately 50 miles from Roanoke, Virginia, 140 miles from Richmond, Virginia, and 180 miles from Washington, D.C.
Washington and Lee was founded in 1749 as a small classical school named Augusta Academy (later Liberty Hall Academy) by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers, though the University has never claimed any sectarian affiliation. In 1796, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock, one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at the time. In gratitude, the school was renamed for the first United States President. In 1865, after his surrender at Appomattox Court House, former General Robert E. Lee served as president of the college until his death in 1870, prompting the college to be renamed as Washington and Lee University. Washington and Lee is the ninth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and the second-oldest in Virginia.

Since 2002 the college has undergone an extensive construction program to convert what was once a World War II navy supply base into a modern, pedestrian-oriented campus. The College employs 431 full- and part-time faculty, exempt and classified salaried employees.
CPTC recently created the Northwest Career &amp; Technical High School.

In Fall of 2003 NWCTHS opened with 21 students. In 2005 it had 16 graduates. The NWC&amp;THS currently has around 200 students.
The college was created by the Clover Park School District in 1942 as a vocational school to train 3,500 civilians as auto mechanics for the nearby McChord Field and Fort Lewis Army Post, and shipfitters, welders and blueprint readers for Tacoma shipyards.
After the war training was expanded to include aircraft mechanics, and Civil Aeronautics Administration certification. In 1954 the vocational school moved to its current location, and since has added over 50 training programs in a wide range of specialties.
Originally named ""Clover Park Vocational Technical Institute,"" in 1991 the school became Clover Park Technical College when the Washington state legislature passed the workforce training bill, converting the state's five two-year vocational schools into technical colleges, and joining them with the state's 29 community colleges.
The school is the home of I-91 FM-KVTI, a 50,000 watt, student operated radio station and ""CollegeVision"" (Comcast ch28 and Click! ch89) which is an educational cable channel available in Pierce County.

Olympic College opened its doors as Olympic Junior College on September 5, 1946. The main building was located in Bremerton, Washington. They had 575 students (423 men and 152 women) and the tuition was $35 per quarter or students had the option to pay for three quarters in advanced for $75.
Olympic College serves Kitsap and Mason counties in Washington. The college's service area contains two major naval installations: Naval Base Kitsap and Naval Hospital Bremerton.
The college's main campus is a 33-acre (13 ha) site located in Bremerton, Washington, and its two satellite campuses are located in Poulsbo and Shelton, Washington. The Poulsbo campus is a 20-acre (8.1 ha) site and is 15.9 miles (25.6 km) from the main campus, while the 27-acre (11 ha) Shelton campus is located 38.4 miles (61.8 km) from the main campus. These three campuses serve more than 12,000 students a year mainly from the 281,374 residents of Kitsap and Mason counties spread over 1,617 square miles (4,190 km2) of wooded and lowland mountain terrain (Census 2000). The student body is predominantly full-time (59%), between the ages of 20–29 (37.7%), and slightly more female than male (56% female). At 73% white, the student body is more diverse than the two counties in which its campuses are located (Kitsap 84% white, Mason 89%), and is more like Seattle (70% white) in King County, which is an hour's ferry ride from Bremerton across the waters of Puget Sound.
The land for both the Shelton and Poulsbo campuses was donated. The 27 acres of land that is now the Shelton campus was donated by Simpson Timber in 1991 and the 20 acres of land that is now the Poulsbo campus was donated by the Olhava Family in 1993.
The school motto is, ""Cogita, Aspira, Aude, Perade (think, aspire, dare, achieve).""
Olympic College has attracted dignitaries and well-known performers during its history. Harry S Truman, the 33rd President of the United States, visited Bremerton and Olympic College (then known as Olympic Junior College) in 1948. He received the first honorary degree from the college that year.
The college offers bachelor's degrees in Nursing, Information Systems, and Organizational Leadership and Technical Management. Through partnerships with local universities like Washington State University and Western Washington University, students can complete and associate degree with Olympic College then transfer into a partner program to earn a bachelor's degree without having to leave Kitsap County.
In 2015, Olympic College was named as one of ten finalists for the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence, the nation’s preeminent recognition of high achievement and performance in America’s community colleges.

Established by the Society of Jesus as Marquette College on August 28, 1881, it was founded by John Martin Henni, the first Bishop of Milwaukee.
The university was named after 17th-century missionary and explorer Father Jacques Marquette, with the intention to provide an affordable Catholic education to the area's emerging German immigrant population. Initially an all-male institution, Marquette became the first coed Catholic university in the world in 1909, when it began admitting its first female students.
Marquette is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. The university is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and currently has a student body of about 12,000. Marquette is one of the largest Jesuit universities in the United States, and the largest private university in Wisconsin.
Marquette is organized into 11 schools and colleges at its main Milwaukee campus, offering programs in the liberal arts, business, communications, education, engineering, law and various health sciences disciplines. The university also administers classes in suburbs around the Milwaukee area and in Washington, DC. While most students are pursuing undergraduate degrees, the university has over 50 doctoral and master's degree programs and 37 graduate certificate programs. The university's varsity athletic teams, known as the Golden Eagles, are members of the Big East Conference and compete in the NCAA's Division I in all sports.

243744,Stanford University,Stanford,94305,"https://www.stanford.edu/",243744.jpg,"Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2) campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.
The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford was a former Governor of California and U.S. Senator; he made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students 125 years ago on October 1, 1891, as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.
Stanford University struggled financially after Leland Stanford's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Following World War II, Provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley. The university is also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.
There are three academic schools that have both undergraduate and graduate students and another four professional schools. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. It has gained 112 NCAA team championships, the second-most for a university, 483 individual championships, the most in Division I, and has won the NACDA Directors' Cup, recognizing the university with the best overall athletic team achievement, for 22 consecutive years, beginning in 1994–1995.
Stanford faculty and alumni have founded a large number of companies that produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue, equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world. It is the alma mater of 30 living billionaires, 17 astronauts, and 20 Turing Award laureates. It is also one of the leading producers of members of the United States Congress. Sixty Nobel laureates and seven Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty or staff.",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,CA,1,2,8,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1,Csb,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,2,3,0,0,700,770,740,800,735,770,32,35,34,36,30,35,34,35,33,1503,6994,53529,53529,24860,113338,20865,1,0.001,0,97798,102547,88873,58448,166805,61965,172245,46844,144104,78,1141,1245,16433,3363,14440,3283,1,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,5,90,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.429434,-122.167359,0.65326686,-2.132222653,3.7,1,1,2,C,72497,74570,72497,72974,70442,69628,60956,25894,83186.2945036915,0.200757659146041,4.06798995436309,3.68729868454787,1

446048,Ave Maria University,Ave Maria,34142-9505,"https://www.avemaria.edu/",446048.png,"Ave Maria University (AMU) is a private Catholic university in Southwest Florida, United States, founded in 2003. The university moved to its permanent campus, situated in the planned town of Ave Maria, 17 miles (27 km) east of Naples, Florida, in August 2007. Ave Maria University shares its history with the former Ave Maria College in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which was founded in 1998 and closed in 2007.
Tom Monaghan, Ave Maria's founder, was the founder of Domino's Pizza. In 2007, Monaghan drew criticism from Catholics both inside and outside the university when he removed theologian Joseph Fessio as provost.
The current enrollment of Ave Maria University is 1,072 students, with 1,019 undergraduate students and 53 graduate students on its campus. The university has seen major growth in recent years and hopes to grow to an enrollment of 1,500 by the year 2020, though President Towey reportedly has guessed the 1,500 student enrollment target could come as early as 2017. The university had a satellite campus in Nicaragua called the Ave Maria University-Latin American Campus, but sold the campus to Keiser University in July 2013. Ave Maria ran the Nicaraguan campus for 13 years. Ave Maria University fields athletic teams known as the Gyrenes. It is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and competes within The Sun Conference.
Academically, the university is rated in ""Tier 2"" by U.S. News &amp; World Report, below 178 other liberal arts colleges in the US. It is included in The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College. In 2015, College Factual ranked Ave Maria University as a Top 10 college in the state of Florida. In December 2015, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools renewed Ave Maria University's accreditation.",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,FL,1,2,5,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,1,Aw,0,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,3,0,1,530,630,510,600,580,555,20,28,20,28,18,26,24,24,22,1155,1093,21854,21854,7292,9470,7630,1,0.001,0,45789,41547,37523,23635,64298,26531,64871,23167,51333,9,212,1260,11990,2905,11990,2905,1,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.335983,-81.438945,0.459649615,-1.42137773,2.8,1,1,4,A,38009,38009,38009,24594,23078,22283,19007,16588,35994.9140271493,0.183710037482315,0.0396612442491387,0.112937568386388,6

It was originally known as Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College, until 1900.
GMC's main facility is the recently restored old Georgia state capitol building (circa 1807)]] --&gt; The main campus in Milledgeville serves approximately 254 full-time, resident ROTC Cadets and 1300 commuter students. GMC's seven campuses, five extension campuses, and online campus across Georgia serves nearly 14,000 students.
GMC is one of five military junior colleges that participates in the U.S. Army's Early Commissioning Program. Students who graduate from GMC's two-year, military science-oriented curriculum receive an officer's commission in the U.S. Army. Although GMC is a state funded institution, it is not part of the University System of Georgia or the Technical College System of Georgia. The junior college was established in 1879, and later added a preparatory school for students in sixth grade through twelfth grade.
GMC's military preparatory school for Cadets is in Baldwin County and has approximately 279 middle school students and 277 high-school Junior ROTC (JROTC)students. The preparatory school's dual enrollment program enables qualified sophomores, juniors, and seniors to attend classes at the junior college and the high school simultaneously, while earning credit for both their high school diploma and their college degree.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,GA,14,1,5,32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,2,Cfa,0,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3,0,1,463,566,453,537,513,494,17,22,15,22,16,21,20,19,19,1024,5457,6525,6525,3374,3077,3963,0,0.001,0,34727,31965,28845,18235,48526,19955,50308,16414,42469,50,482,855,7500,3441,4730,4165,0,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.999,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,19,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.07944,-83.224211,0.577345143,-1.452536499,2.555,1,0,3,C,16275,18321,16275,4650,3123,1570,89,-322,0,0.200757659146041,-0.807259695209444,-0.624233491971961,8
